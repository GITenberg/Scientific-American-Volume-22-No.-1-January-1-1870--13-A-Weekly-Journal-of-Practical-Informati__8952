<h2>Engines of the Spanish Gunboats.</h2>

<p>In our description of these boats in No. 25, Vol. XXI., special
mention was made of the compactness of the engines.</p>

<p>It has frequently been urged as an objection against the twin
screw system that the double set of engines, four steam cylinders
with duplicates of all the working parts called for on this system,
render the whole too complicated and heavy for small vessels,
preventing, at the same time, the application of surface
condensation. In the engines of the Spanish gunboats, of which we
annex an illustration from <i>Engineering</i>, the designer,
Captain Ericsson, has overcome these objections by introducing a
surface condenser, which, while it performs the function of
condensing the steam to be returned to the boiler in the form of
fresh water, serves as the principal support of the engines,
dispensing entirely with the usual framework. Besides this
expedient, each pair of cylinders have their slide frames for
guiding the movements of the piston rods cast in one piece.
Altogether the combination, is such that the total weight and space
occupied by these novel twin screw engines do not exceed the
ordinary single screw engines of equal power. Several improvements
connected with the working gear have been introduced.</p>

<p class="ctr">ENGINES OF THE TWIN SCREW SPANISH GUNBOATS</p>

<p>The outer bearings of the propeller shafts, always difficult to
regulate and keep in order on the twin screw system, are
selfadjusting and accommodate themselves to every change of the
direction of the shafts. This is effected by their being spherical
externally, and resting in corresponding cavities in the stern
braces or hangers. The spring bearings for supporting the middle of
the shafts are also arranged on a similar self-adjusting
principle.</p>

<p>The thrust bearing is of peculiar construction, the arrangement
being such that the bearing surfaces remain in perfect contact
however much the shaft may be out of line. The reversing gear
likewise is quite peculiar, insuring complete control over the
movement of the two propellers under all circumstances. It is
claimed that these engines are the lightest and most compact yet
constructed for twin screw vessels.</p>

<h2>The Torpedo Boat Problem.</h2>

<p>The <i>Army and Navy Journal</i> thinks the problem of a torpedo
boat capable of firing rapidly and with certainty, has at length
reached a satisfactory solution. It says:</p>

<p>"A boat has been completed which is proved by experiment to be
faultless in machinery and arrangement. On the 2d of December,
Secretary Robeson, Vice-Admiral Porter, and Commodore Case, Chief
of the Bureau of Ordnance, went to the Navy Yard at Washington, to
witness the experiment with this new engine of destruction. After
examining the workings of the machinery, and the manner of firing,
one of the destructives was put in the frame and the party
proceeded to the shore to witness the result. A torpedo of only
thirty-six pounds was first run out with rapidity and fired; but
the result showed that this small amount of powder, even, would
have been sufficient to destroy any ship, by lifting her out of the
water and breaking her back, even if her bottom was not knocked out
altogether. Mud and water were thrown up together, and the
concussion was felt far up in the Navy Yard, the ground being
shaken by the shock of the powder against the bed of the river. The
concussion felt on board the torpedo-boat was not more than that
caused by a wave striking a vessel at sea.</p>

<p>"Several torpedoes were fired from the vessel, the explosion of
which the party witnessed on board, as they desired to ascertain
for themselves the effect of the shock. The result seemed
satisfactory, as no change whatever is contemplated in the
machinery, which is very simple, and 'works to a charm.' The
torpedo vessel is the <i>Nina</i>, a very strong iron boat of three
hundred and fifty tuns burden, capable of crossing the ocean, and
having a speed of seventeen knots an hour. She is not impervious to
heavy shot, but can be made so, and is capable of resisting any
ordinary projectile that could be brought to bear on her from the
decks of a ship of war. Her decks will be made torpedo and
shot-proof, and several arrangements will be applied, now that it
is known that the torpedo system is a success. Such a vessel as the
<i>Nina</i>, attacking an enemy's squadron on our coast some dark
night, or entering an enemy's port, could destroy half the vessels
in the harbor, and easily escape as few vessels could overtake her.
Such a vessel could, for instance, enter the harbor of Havana, and
destroy every vessel of war in the port, under cover of darkness. A
squadron supplied with such boats to be used to attack, after the
fight began, and the ships were enveloped in smoke, would have a
most decided advantage against an enemy not thus armed for torpedo
warfare. It is reported that our torpedo navy will consist of
twenty vessels, none of which will have a less speed than twelve
knots, and the fastest of them will go seventeen knots."</p>

<h2>SUGAR MAKING IN LOUISIANA.</h2>

<p>The New Orleans <i>Times</i> contains, in a late number, an
account of the manufacture of sugar as conducted on the Poychas
estate, from which we extract portions containing the essential
particulars of cane sugar making as conducted in the southern
portions of the United States.</p>

<p>"Reaching the Cane shed, the crop, dumped into piles, is
received by a crowd of feeders, who place it (eight or ten stalks
at a time) on the cane carrier. This is an elevator, on an endless
band of wood and iron, which carries them to the second story,
where the stalks drop between the rollers. An immense iron tank
below, called a juice box, receives the liquid portion, and another
elevator bears the bruised and broken fragments to the opposite
side of the building, where they are dropped into the bagasse
burner.</p>

<p>"This invention, at its introduction, caused more scientific
inquiry and dispute, probably, than any other of the age, and
settled beyond question the possibility of combustion, without the
use of atmospheric air. The process consists in dropping the wet,
spongy mass into a fire of wood or coal, and closing the furnace
doors. The steam arising from the drying matter passes to a chamber
in the rear, where, by the intense heat, it is decomposed. Oxygen
and hydrogen (both strong combustibles) unite with the carbon,
reaching there in the form of smoke, and a white heat is the
result.</p>

<p>"Cane juice, as it escapes from the mill, could scarcely be
considered inviting to either palate or vision. The sweet, slimy
mass of fluid, covered with foam, and filled with sticks, has more
the appearance of the water in a brewer's vat than anything which
now suggests itself. A small furnace, containing a quantity of
burning sulphur, sends through a tube a volume of its stifling
fumes, and these, caught by jets of steam, thoroughly impregnate
the contents of the juice box. Having received its first lesson in
cleanliness, the liquid now rises through a tube to the series of
clarifiers on the second floor. They are heated by a chain of steam
pipes running along the bottom, and being filled, the juice slowly
simmers Much of the foreign substance rises in a scum to the
surface and is skimmed off by the sugar maker. It is further
purified by the addition of Thomaston or what is called sugar lime.
At one half a peck is considered sufficient for seven hundred and
fifty gallons of juice, but much depends upon the quantity of
saccharine matter it contains. Another set of pipes now permit the
liquor to run into the evaporators, in the boiling room below.
These are also heated by circles of steam pipes, and the liquid is
first gently simmered, to enable any additional foreign substance
to rise to the surface and be skimmed off.</p>

<p>"After that the steam is turned on fully, and the juice boils
until it reaches the solidity of twenty-five degrees, as measured
by the saccharometer. This point attained, more pipes conduct it to
a series of square iron tanks called filterers. Each is provided
with a false bottom, covered with thick woolen blankets, and
through these the juice slowly drips into an immense iron vessel
called a sirup tank.</p>

<p>"The process of cleaning has now been completed, and the sirup
is pumped into the covered vessel previously alluded to, called the
vacuum pan.</p>

<p>"This is also heated by layers of steam pipes, and here the
liquor boils until the process of crystallization is completed.
This end achieved, another conductor permits the substance to
slowly descend to a large square iron tank, called a strike-pan.
The process of emptying the vacuum pan is technically called a
"strike." We now find a reddish brown substance, having somewhat
the appearance of soft mortar.</p>

<p>"Men are at hand with square wooden boxes, and while the sugar
is still warm, it is placed in rotary cylinders, protected on the
inside by wire guards, called centrifugals.</p>

<p>"Placed on a horizontal, they revolve with a velocity which
frequently reaches 1200 a minute. The damp, dingy looking pile
instantly spreads, a broad circle of yellow is first visible on the
inner rim of the machine, and this slowly whitening finally becomes
a shining ring of snowy sugar. To effect this result requires the
aid of nine steam boilers, three steam engines, a vacuum pan, three
large evaporators, five clarifiers, five filters, an immense sirup
tank, the juice box, mill, bagasse furnace, and fifteen
coolers.</p>

<p>"With the engineers, sugar makers, firemen, and laborers,
thirty-eight persons are constantly on duty in this
sugar-house.</p>

<p>"Doubling this number, to give each the necessary rest, swells
the gathering to seventy-six souls, who, during the grinding
season, find employment at the sugar-house alone. This of course
does not include the laborers employed in gathering and bringing in
the crop, and the great number occupied in odd jobs and the
extensive repairs which are constantly going on."</p>

<h2>Sticking, or Court Plaster.</h2>

<p>This plaster is well known from its general use and its healing
properties. It is merely a kind of varnished silk, and its
manufacture is very easy.</p>

<p>Bruise a sufficient quantity of isinglass, and let it soak in a
little warm water for four-and-twenty hours; expose it to heat over
the fire till the greater part of the water is dissipated, and
supply its place by proof spirits of wine, which will combine with
the isinglass. Strain the whole through a piece of open linen,
taking care that the consistence of the mixture shall be such that,
when cool, it may form a trembling jelly.</p>

<p>Extend the piece of black silk, of which you propose making your
plaster, on a wooden frame, and fix it in that position by means of
tacks or pack-thread. Then apply the isinglass (after it has been
rendered liquid by a gentle heat) to the silk with a brush of fine
hair (badgers' is the best). As soon as this first coating is
dried, which will not be long, apply a second; and afterwards, if
you wish the article to be very superior, a third. When the whole
is dry, cover it with two or three coatings of the balsam of
Peru.</p>

<p>This is the genuine court plaster. It is pliable, and never
breaks, which is far from being the case with many of the spurious
articles which are sold under that name. Indeed, this commodity is
very frequently adulterated. A kind of plaster, with a very thick
and brittle covering, is often sold for it. The manufacturers of
this, instead of isinglass, use common glue, which is much cheaper;
and cover the whole with spirit varnish, instead of balsam of Peru.
This plaster cracks, and has none of the balsamic smell by which
the genuine court plaster is distinguished. Another method of
detecting the adulteration is to moisten it with your tongue <i>on
the side opposite to that which is varnished</i>; and, if the
plaster be genuine, it will adhere exceedingly well. The
adulterated plaster is too hard for this; it will not stick, unless
you moisten it on the varnished side.--<i>The Painter, Gilder, and
Varnisher's Companion</i>.</p>

<h2>AN IMPROVED HOISTING PULLEY WANTED.</h2>

<p>A gentleman of this city has sent us the accompanying diagram of
an improved hoisting pulley, for which he say she would be willing
to pay any reasonable price provided he knew where to obtain
it--the wheel, not the price. It is a pulley within a pulley, the
friction of the outer one upon the inner one--the latter being held
by a ratchet and pawl-acting as a brake in lowering weights, while
both would turn together in elevating weights. The idea is rather
an ingenious one, but we are confident our inventors can attain a
like object by simpler means.</p>

<p>THE VACUUM METHOD OF MAKING ICE.--An ice and cold producing
machine has been invented by Herr Franz Windhausen, Brunswick. The
action of the machine is based on the principle of producing cold
by the expansion of atmospheric air, which is accomplished by means
of mechanical power. The machines require no chemicals, nothing
being used in them but water and atmospheric air. They may be
wrought by steam, water, or wind, and they produce from 100 to
1,000 lbs. of ice per hour, according to size, at a cost of from
2d. to 5d. per 100 lbs., this difference resulting from the varying
prices of fuel and the mode of working chosen. One of their uses is
to cool rooms, cellars, theaters, hospitals, compartments of ships,
etc.--<i>Builder</i>.</p>

<h2>FERDINAND DE LESSEPS--CHIEF PROMOTER OF THE SUEZ CANAL.</h2>

<h3>[From the Phrenological Journal.]</h3>

<p>The scheme of re-opening the canal of the Pharaohs between the
Mediterranean and Red seas, and thus connecting by a short cut
across the Isthmus of Suez the commerce of Europe and Asia, though
long entertained by the first Napoleon, may fairly be claimed for
M. de Lesseps. His attention was doubtless first drawn to it by
reading the memorable report of M. la P&eacute;re, who was employed
by Bonaparte to make a survey in 1798. The credit of designing and
executing the great work belongs alike to him. With the general
plan, progress, and purpose of the Canal, the American reader has,
during the past few months, been made tolerably familiar.</p>

<p>He is the son of Jean Baptiste Barthelemi, Baron de Lesseps, who
was born at Cette, a French port on the Mediterranean, in 1765.
Jean Baptiste was for five years French Vice-Consul at St.
Petersburg. In 1785 he accompanied La Perouse on a voyage to
Kamtchatka, whence he brought by land the papers containing a
description of the expedition. In 1788 he was Consul at Kronstadt
and St. Petersburg. From St. Petersburg he was called, in 1812, by
the Emperor Napoleon, to Moscow, as <i>intendant</i>. From the
latter city, in 1814, he proceeded to Lisbon, and was stationed
there as Consul until 1823. He died at Paris, May 6, 1834.</p>

<p>Ferdinand, the subject of this sketch, was born at Versailles in
1805, and is consequently in his sixty-fourth year, though his
appearance is that of a man little past the meridian of life. Early
in life he evinced peculiar aptitude for the diplomatic career in
which he has since distinguished himself--a career as varied and
romantic as it is brilliant. In 1825 he was appointed
<i>attach&eacute;</i> to the French Consulate at Lisbon. Two years
later found him engaged in the Commercial Department of the
Minister of Foreign Affairs. During the latter part of 1828 he was
<i>attach&eacute;</i> to the Consul-General at Tunis; and in 1831
he was dispatched by his Government as Consul to Alexandria. Hard
work and rapid promotion for <i>le jeune diplomat!</i> But the most
eventful period of his long and wonderfully active career lay yet
before him.</p>

<p>Seven years subsequent to his appointment at Alexandria, and
consequently when he was in his thirty-fifth year, he was sent as
Consul to Rotterdam. From Rotterdam he proceeded to Malaga in 1839,
to negotiate in behalf of French commerce with the Spanish
Government. In the latter part of the same year he was transferred
to the Consulate at Barcelona, where during the two subsequent
years he was especially active, and signally distinguished himself
against the reign of Espartero. In 1844 we again find him in
Alexandria, whither he was sent to take the place of Lavalette. But
the time for the development of his great project had not yet come.
He did not long remain in the Egyptian capital. Returning to his
former position in Barcelona he was witness to some of the scenes
of the revolution of February. In 1848 he was appointed French
Minister at the court of Madrid. Remaining in the Spanish capital
about a year, he returned to Paris immediately after the revolution
of '48, and in May of the following year was dispatched as Envoy of
the French Republic to the Republican Government of Mazzini at
Rome, where he took a leading part in the abortive negotiations
which preceded the restoration of the Pope by a French army.</p>

<p class="ctr"><img src="images/2b.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In 1854 he received a commission from the <i>Soci&eacute;te
d'&eacute;tudes du Canal de Suez</i> at Paris to negotiate with
S&auml;id Pacha for the construction of the canal projected in
1816. Accordingly, toward the close of that year, we again find him
on the Isthmus, preparing for his great work. This time he came to
conquer. His mission was crowned with success, and the necessary
concession made in November of that year. A palace and a retinue of
servants were assigned to his use, and he was treated, as a guest
of the Viceroy, with the utmost respect. Great opposition followed,
especially from England; and it was not till January, 1856, that
the second and fuller concession was granted by S&auml;id Pacha,
and a <i>Compagnie International</i> fully organized.</p>

<p>In 1858 M. Lesseps succeeded in raising two hundred millions of
francs in France, and in 1859 he proceeded to Egypt and planted the
Egyptian flag in the harbor of the ancient Pelusium, the great
sea-port of Egypt thirty centuries ago, where Port S&auml;id now
stands. He laid, at the same time, the foundation of a lighthouse,
and proudly proclaimed the work commenced. Fresh
difficulties--chiefly of a political nature--interposed, but the
indefatigable Lesseps never despaired. In 1859 he had the
satisfaction of seeing his company and work placed upon a firm
footing, though the final decision of the French Emperor was not
given till July, 1864. From that time to the present hour the Canal
has steadily progressed toward completion.</p>

<p>The personal appearance of M. de Lesseps is very striking.
Though long past middle age, he has a fresh and even youthful
appearance. Both face and figure are well preserved; his slightly
curling gray hair sets off in pleasing contrast his bronzed yet
clear complexion, his bright eye, and genial smile. He is somewhat
over the medium stature, possessed of a compact and well-knit
frame, carries his head erect, and moves about with a buoyancy and
animation perfectly marvelous in one of his years and experience.
His address is that of the well-bred, well-educated French
gentleman that he is. His manner is winning, his voice clear and
under most excellent control, as all those who have listened to his
admirable lectures on the Canal at the late Paris Exposition cannot
fail to remember. What is perhaps most remarkable in a man so bred
and constituted, is that with great gentleness of speech and
suavity of manner he combines a strength of will and fixity of
purpose worthy of Napoleon or Caesar himself. Beneath that calm
exterior lay a power which needed but the stimulus of a great idea
to develop.</p>

<p>Though beset by difficulties, laughed at, and maligned, he has
never for a moment swerved from his purpose or relaxed his efforts
to accomplish it. Neither the sneers of Stevenson and his associate
engineers, the heavy broadside of the "Thunderer," or the squibs of
<i>Punch</i>, ever made any visible impression on the purpose or
action of Lesseps.--"My purpose from the commencement was to have
confidence," said he.</p>

<p>How bravely he has maintained his principle and redeemed his
pledge let the ceremonies which marked the completion and
inauguration of his great work tell--when sea sent greeting to sea;
and let the keels of richly laden argosies from Cathay and from
Ind, which plow the waters of the Canal, declare.</p>

<h2>AN INGENIOUS VENT PEG.</h2>

<p>The engraving illustrates an English invention of value in that
it provides a means of giving vent to casks from which liquids are
to be drawn, at the same time excluding the air when the drawing is
discontinued, and thus preventing deterioration in the liquid by
undue exposure to air.</p>

<p class="ctr"><img src="images/2c.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The principle on which it operates is that of admitting just so
much air as may be required to fill the vacant space produced by
the withdrawal of the liquor from time to time, and affording this
air no egress, thus hermetically sealing the barrel. This is
effected by means of a valve opening inward, at the upper portion
of the peg, so long as the density of the exterior air is in excess
of that within. This action takes place at the very instant of the
flow of the liquid, and ceases with it; for at that instant all
further supply is shut off, there being no further pressure.</p>

<p>THE LARGE TREES OF TEXAS.--The large court-house of Navarro
county is said to have been covered with shingles made from a
single cedar tree. The oaks, pecans, and cedars of that section of

three hours, to transmit a telegraphic message to a distant city,
yet it is the mechanical adjustment by the sender and receiver

<h2>A New English Patent Pulley Block.</h2>

<p>The following description of a new pulley block, which we take
from the <i>Ironmonger</i>, does not give as clear an idea of the
invention as could be desired, but it shows that invention in this
field has not yet exhausted itself:</p>

<p class="ctr"><img src="images/3a.png" alt=""></p>

<p>"The block is made on the differential principle. The lifting
chain is passed over two sheaves, each of which is geared
internally, the one having one or more teeth in excess of the
other. Revolving around these internal teeth is a pinion, actuated
by an eccentric, which is keyed on to a shaft passing through the
center of the block, with a bearing at each end in the outside
frame of the block. At one end of this shaft is a wheel with an
endless hand chain passing over it; this gives the motion to the
eccentric shaft. The teeth of the internal pinion are broad enough
to gear into the teeth of both the sheaves, but as there is more
teeth in one than in the other, they (the teeth) are not exactly
opposite each other, and therefore will not admit the teeth of the
revolving pinion without moving; but the tooth of the pinion,
acting as a wedge, and entering with great power, pushes the one
tooth forward and the other tooth back; and this continually
occurring, a continual rotary motion is given to the sheaves, in
opposite directions, with a power which is proportioned to the
number of the teeth, the throw of eccentric, and the leverage
gained by the diameter of the hand wheel. The lifting chain is
passed over the one sheave, then down, and up over the other, the
two ends being attached to a powerful cross bar, to which is
connected the lifting hook. By this means the weight is distributed
over the two sheaves and the two parts of the chain, increasing the
safety and diminishing the friction of the block.</p>

<p>"The blocks are very simple in construction, and are not at all
liable to get out of order; the construction being such that the
weight cannot run down, though the men lifting let go the chain.
They hang quite plumb when in action, and the men are able to stand
clear away from under the load, as the hand-wheel chain can be
worked at any angle."</p>

<h2>Plants In Sleeping Rooms.</h2>

<p>The following from the able pen of Dr. J.C. Draper, in the
January number of the <i>Galaxy</i>, will answer some inquiries
lately received on the subject, and is a brief, but clear
exposition of the injurious effects of plants in sleeping
apartments:</p>

<p>"Though the air is dependent for the renewal of its oxygen on
the action of the green leaves of plants, it must not be forgotten
that it is only in the presence and under the stimulus of light
that these organisms decompose carbonic acid. All plants,
irrespective of their kind or nature, absorb oxygen and exhale
carbonic acid in the dark. The quantity of noxious gas thus
eliminated is, however, exceedingly small when compared with the
oxygen thrown out during the day. When they are flowering, plants
exhale carbonic acid in considerable quantity, and at the same time
evolve heat. In this condition, therefore, they resemble animals as
regards their relation to the air; and a number of plants placed in
a room would, under these circumstances, tend to vitiate the
air.</p>

<p>"While the phanerogamia, or flowering plants, depend on the air
almost entirely for their supply of carbon, and are busy during the
day in restoring to it the oxygen that has been removed by animals,
many of the inferior cryptogamia, as the fungi and parasitic
plants, obtain their nourishment from material that has already
been organized. They do not absorb carbonic acid, but, on the
contrary, they act like animals, absorbing oxygen and exhaling
carbonic acid at all times. It is, therefore, evident that their
presence in a room cannot be productive of good results.</p>

<p>"Aside from the highly deleterious action that plants may exert
on the atmosphere of a sleeping room, by increasing the proportion
of carbonic acid during the night, there is another and more
important objection to be urged against their presence in such
apartments. Like animals, they exhale peculiar volatile organic
principles, which in many instances render the air unfit for the
purposes of respiration. Even in the days of Andronicus this fact
was recognized, for he says, in speaking of Arabia Felix, that 'by
reason of myrrh, frankincense, and hot spices there growing, the
air was so obnoxious to their brains, that the very inhabitants at
some times cannot avoid its influence.' What the influence on the
brains of the inhabitants may have been does not at present
interest us: we have only quoted the statement to show that long
ago the emanations from plants were regarded as having an influence
on the condition of the air; and, in view of our present ignorance,
it would be wise to banish them from our sleeping apartments, at
least until we are better informed regarding their true
properties."</p>

<h2>Improved Method of Catching Curculios.</h2>

<p>This is a novel and curious invention, made by Dr. Hull, of
Alton, Ill., for the purpose of jarring off and catching the
curculio from trees infested by this destructive insect. It is a
barrow, with arms and braces covered with cloth, and having on one
side a slot, which admits the stem of the tree. The curculio
catcher, or machine, is run against the tree three or four times,
with sufficient force to impart a jarring motion to all its parts.
The operator then backs far enough to bring the machine to the
center of the space between the rows, turns round, and in like
manner butts the tree in the opposite row. In this way a man may
operate on three hundred trees per hour.</p>

<p>A bag and a broom are carried by the operator by which the
insects are swept from the cloth and consigned to destruction.</p>

<h2>Remains of a Megatherium in Ohio.</h2>

<p>The Columbus <i>State Journal</i>, of Dec. 6, says "there is now
on exhibition at the rooms of the State Board of Agriculture, or
headquarters of the Geological Corps, a section of the femur or
thigh bone of an animal of the mastodon species, the fossilized
remains of which were recently discovered in Union county. These
remains were found in a drift formation about three feet below the
surface, and are similar to the remains of the Megatherium found in
other parts of the State. Arrangements were made by Mr. Klippart,
of the Geological Corps, to have the skeleton or the parts thereof
removed with proper care. Before excavations had proceeded far bad
weather set in, and work has been abandoned. The section of the
femur, upper part, with socket ball, is about twenty inches in
length, or about half the length of the thigh bone. This would make
the aggregate length of the bones of the leg about ten feet. The
ball is twenty-two inches in circumference, and the bone lower
down, of course, much larger. From the part of the skeleton
secured, it is estimated that the hight of the animal was twelve
and a half feet, and the skeleton entire much larger than the
specimen now in the British Museum. As this particular species, or
remains thereof, have been found only in Ohio, this specimen has
been named the <i>Megatharium Ohioensis</i>. The animals lived, it
is supposed, in the period immediately preceding the human period,
and were after the elephant type.</p>

<p>Exhuming operations will be resumed in the spring, and if the
skeleton is removed in good shape or a good state of preservation,
it will be set up in the Echo room at the Capitol, where the
fossils collected by the Geological Corps are now being arranged
and stored.</p>

<h2>Artificial Ivory.</h2>

<p>A process for producing artificial ivory has been published in a
German journal. The inventor makes a solution of india-rubber in
chloroform and passes chlorine gas through it. After this, he heats
the solution to drive off any excess of chlorine, and also the
solvent, whereupon he has left behind a pasty mass with which it is
only necessary to incorporate sufficient precipitated carbonate of
lime or sulphate of lead, or, indeed, any other dense white powder,
to obtain a material which may be pressed into molds to form
whatever articles may be desired. The details of this process are
obviously incomplete, and the success of it may be doubted. Only
good and well masticated rubber could be employed, and even then a
dilute solution must be made, and any earthy impurities allowed to
deposit. In the next place, we are doubtful of the bleaching action
of chlorine on rubber, and, moreover, chloroform is, under some
circumstances, decomposed by chlorine. Lastly, it is clear that, to
obtain a hard material at all resembling ivory, it would be
necessary to make a "hard cure," for which a considerable
proportion of sulphur would be required. The simple purification of
india-rubber by means of chloroform, would, however, furnish a mass
of a very fair color.</p>

<h2>AMERICAN AND ENGLISH RAILWAY PRACTICE CONTRASTED.</h2>

<p>A paper on "American Locomotives and Rolling Stock," read before
the Institution of Civil Engineers, in England, with an abstract on
the discussion thereon, has been forwarded to us by the publishers,
William Clowes and Sons, Stamford street and Charing Cross,
London.</p>

<p>We have seldom met with a pamphlet of greater interest and
value. The whole subject of American as contrasted with English
railroad practice is reviewed, and the differences which exist,
with the necessities for such differences ably discussed. Mr.
Colburn shows these differences to be external rather than
fundamental, and traces many of the peculiarities of American
construction to the "initiative of English engineers." The cause
for the adoption and retention of these peculiarities he attributes
to "the necessities of a new country and the comparative scarcity
of capital," and thinks that but for these causes" American
railways and their rolling stock would have doubtless been
constructed, as in other countries, upon English models, and
worked, in most respects, upon English principles of
management.</p>

<p>He reviews the origin and introduction of American features of
railway practice, and points out as the distinguishing feature of
American locomotives and rolling stock the bogie, or swiveling
truck. "Keeping in mind the distinguishing merits of the bogie, the
other differences between English and American locomotives are
differences more of costume and of toilet than of vital principles
of construction."</p>

<p>The author attributes the origin of the greater subdivision of
rolling weight and consequent coupling of wheels on American roads
to the comparatively weak and imperfect permanent way, estimating
the maximum weight per wheel as being for many years four English
tuns, while three tuns he considers, as more than the average for
each coupled wheel of American locomotives.</p>

<p>To follow the author through the whole of his able paper, and
the discussion which it elicited, would occupy more of our space
than we can spare for the purpose. We will, however, give in the
author's own language, an account of an experiment conducted by him
in 1855 on the Erie Railroad.</p>

<p>"In the autumn of 1855, the author, at the request of Mr. (now
General) M'Callum, the manager of the Erie Railroad, took charge of
an experimental train, which he ran over the whole length of the
line and back, a total distance of nearly 900 miles. The same
engine was employed throughout the run, occupying in all nearly
three weeks, making an average for each week day of about 50 miles.
The line is divided into four divisions, varying considerably in
respect of gradients, and the utmost load the engine could draw was
taken in both directions over each division. The maximum
inclinations were 1 in 88. The results of the experiments were so
voluminous, that it will be sufficient to detail the particulars of
what may be termed crucial tests of adhesion and resistance to
traction.</p>

<p>"The engine had four coupled wheels and a bogie, the total
weight in working trim being 29&frac12; tuns, of which 17-7/8 tuns
rested on the coupled wheels available for adhesion. The coupled
wheels were 5 feet in diameter; the outside cylinders were 17
inches in diameter, and the stroke 24 inches. The safety valves
were set to blow off at 130 lbs., and the steam, as observed by a
Bourdon gage, was seldom allowed to exceed that limit. No indicator
diagrams were taken, nor was any measure taken of the wood burnt,
all that could be consumed by the engine, in maintaining the
requisite steam, being supplied. The tender, loaded, weighed 181
tuns. The train drawn consisted of eight-wheel wagons fully loaded
with deals. The average weight of each wagon was 5 tuns 8 cwt. 3
qrs., and of each wagon with its load 15 tuns 5 cwt. 3 qrs. nearly.
The wagons had cast-iron chilled wheels, each 2 feet 6 inches in
diameter, with inside journals 3 7/8 inches in diameter, and 8
inches long. All the wagons had been put in complete order, and the
journals, fitted with oil-tight boxes, were kept well oiled. The
gage of the line was 6 feet. The weather was most favorable, clear
and dry, with the exception of a single day of heavy rain.</p>

<p>"Upon about one hundred miles of the line, forming a portion of
the Susquehanna division, a train of one hundred wagons, weighing,
with engine and tender, 1,572 tuns was taken. The train was a few
feet more than half a mile in length.</p>

<p>"At one point it was stopped where the line commenced an ascent
of 24 feet in four miles, averaging 1 in 880 up for the whole
distance. There were also long and easy curves upon this portion.
The train was taken up and purposely stopped on the second mile, to
be sure of starting again with no aid from momentum. The average
speed was 5 miles an hour, and neither was the pressure of steam
increased nor sand used except in starting from the stops purposely
made. The engine, even were its full boiler pressure of 130 lbs.
maintained as effective pressure upon the pistons throughout the
whole length of their stroke, could not have exerted a tractive
force greater than (17 x 17 x 130 lbs. x 2 ft.)/ 5 ft = 15,028
lbs.; nor is it at all probable that the effective cylinder
pressure could have approached this limit by from 10 lbs. to 15
lbs. per square inch. Supposing, however, for the sake of a
reductio ad absurdum, that the full boiler pressure had been
maintained upon the pistons for the whole length of their strokes,
the adhesion of the coupled driving wheels, not deducting the
internal resistances of the engine, would have been 15028/40050 3/8
of the weight upon them. In any case there was a resistance of
4,011 lbs. due to gravity, and if even 120 lbs. mean effective
cylinder pressure be assumed, corresponding to a total tractive
force of 13,872 lbs., the quotient representing the rolling and
other resistances, exclusive of gravity, would be but 6.27 lbs. per
tun of the entire train; a resistance including all the internal
resistances of the engine, the resistance of the curves, easy
although they were, and the loss in accelerating and retarding the
train in starting and stopping. This estimate of resistance would
correspond, at the observed speed of 5 miles an hour (upwards of
&frac34; of an hour having been consumed on the 4 miles), to 185
indicated H.P., which, with the driving wheels, making but 28
revolutions per minute, would be the utmost that an engine with but
1,038 square feet of heating surface could be expected to exert.
This was the highest result observed during the three weeks' trial,
but one or two others are worthy of mention. On the Delaware
division of the same line, the train, of 1,572 tuns' weight, was
run over 5 consecutive miles of absolutely level line, at a mean
rate of 9.23 miles an hour, and during the same day, over 5 other
consecutive miles of level at a mean rate of 9.7 miles per hour. On
both levels there were 14&frac12; chain curves of good length, and
the speed, from 9 to 12 miles an hour, at which the train entered
the respective levels, was not quite regularly maintained
throughout the half hour expended in running over them. But if even
7 lbs. per tun of the total weight be taken as the resistance at
these speeds, the tractive force will be 11,004 lbs., which is more
than one fourth the adhesion weight of 40,050 lbs. On the next day,
the same engine drew 30 wagons weighing 466&frac12; tuns, or,
including engine and tender, 514 tuns nearly, up a gradient of 1 in
117&frac12;, three miles long, at a mean speed of 10&frac14; miles
an hour. The resistance due to gravity was 9,814 lbs., and
supposing the other resistance to traction to amount to no more
than 7 lbs. per tun, the total resistance would be 13,412 lbs.,
corresponding to a mean effective cylinder pressure of 117 lbs. per
square inch, and to a co-efficient of adhesion of almost exactly
one third.</p>

<p>"It is needless to repeat instances of much the same kind, as
occurring during the experiment referred to. The author is bound to
say that they were, no doubt, influenced by the favorable
circumstances of weather, and something is to be allowed also for
the great length of train drawn, very long trains having a less
tractive resistance per tun on a level than short ones, and
something, possibly more than is commonly supposed, may have been
due to the use of oil-tight axle boxes, the saponaceous compound
known as 'railway grease' being nowhere in use on railways in the
States. It could not possibly be used, except in a congealed form,
in the severe American winters; and Messrs. Guebhard and
Dieudonn&eacute;'s experiments (<i>vide</i> "De la
r&eacute;sistance des trains et de la puissance des machines." 8vo.
Paris, 1868, p. 36) made in 1867, on the Eastern Railway of France,
showed a very considerable diminution in the resistance of
oil-boxed rolling stock as compared with that fitted with grease
boxes. But, weighed upon the other hand, are the facts, first, that
the line was of 6-feet gage, and, <i>pro tanto</i>, so much the
worse for traction; secondly, that the wheels were comparatively
small, and the inside journals of comparatively large diameter, the
ratio of the former to the latter being as 7&frac34; to 1, instead
of 12 to 1 as on English lines. It is difficult to believe that the
length and steadiness of the double bogie goods wagons, scarcely
liable as they are to lateral vibrations, had not something to do
with the result, which is in some respects unique in the history of
railway traction. The result, although not absolutely showing the
real resistance to traction, nor the real adhesion of the engine,
presents this alternative; namely, that the resistance must have
been unusually small, or the adhesion unusually large."</p>

<p>In the discussion which followed some doubts were expressed as
to the accuracy of Mr. Colburn's conclusions, drawn from the
experiments described; but it was conceded by some who took part in
the discussion that some of the features of our practice might be
advantageously copied in England. For the most part, however, the
opinion prevailed that the features of our system, which are here
regarded as almost indispensable, could not be introduced into
English practice with advantage.</p>

<h2>BOILER COVERING.</h2>

<h3>BY C.M. O'HARA, C.E.</h3>

<p>At the regular weekly meeting of the Polytechnic Association of
the American Institute, held on Thursday evening, the 25th ult.,
the subject of boiler clothing was discussed at some length, but
without any decisive conclusion being arrived at respecting the
most serviceable and economical material for that purpose. It
appeared from the testimony adduced, that though there is a variety
of substances in use, even those which are practically acknowledged
as being the most efficient are far from coming up to the required
standard of utility, and are characterized by defects which are at
once forced upon us by a little close examination. Felt is an
admirable non-conductor of heat, but owing to its combustible
nature it is quite unreliable when subject to the heat of a high
pressure of steam. A large fragment of this material which had been
taken off the boiler of a North River steamboat was exhibited at
the meeting, scorched and charred as if it had been exposed to the
direct action of fire. For these reasons felt covering is,
generally speaking, confined to boilers in which a comparatively
low pressure of steam is maintained. But even under the most
favorable circumstances of actual wear its durability is limited to
a short period.</p>

<p>Powdered charcoal possesses the elements of efficiency as a
non-conductor in an eminent degree; but its susceptibility of
taking fire militates strongly against its adoption as a boiler
covering.</p>

<p>Besides the materials above mentioned, there are some which come
under the denomination of cements; but the use of such is somewhat
at variance with what a dull world would call "facts." Employing
them as a clothing for a vessel in which it is necessary to retain
heat is certainly the wrong way of doing a light thing, if the
evidence of distinguished experimenters be worth anything.</p>

<p>The researches of most well-informed physical philosophers go to
prove that the conducting properties of bodies are augmented by
cohesion, and that heat is conveyed profusely and energetically
through all solid and ponderable substances. Thus gold, silver, and
others of the most solid metals are the best conductors. Next to
the pure metals in conducting powers are rocks, flints, porcelain,
earthenware, and the denser liquids as the solutions of the acids
and alkalies. As a further evidence to prove that the passage of
heat through all substances is increased by cohesion, even some of
those which are known to be among the best conductors are deprived
of this property by a division or disintegration of their
particles. Pure silica in the state of hard, rock crystal is a
better conductor than bismuth or lead; but if the rock crystal be
pulverized, the diffusion of heat through its powder is very slow
and feeble. Heat is conducted swiftly and copiously through
transparent rock salt, but pulverization converts the solid mass
into a good non-conductor. Caloric has for the same reason a
stronger affinity for pure metals than for their oxides.</p>

<p>Again, wood is known to be a better non-conductor when reduced
to shavings or sawdust than when in the solid state. It is probably
on this account that trees are protected by bark, which is not
nearly so dense and hard a body as the wood. Wool, silk, and cotton
are much diminished in conducting qualities when spun and woven,
for the reason that their fibers are brought closer together.</p>

<p>Count Rumford discovered that hot water, at a given temperature,
when placed in a vessel jacketed with a clothing of twisted silk,
and plunged into a freezing mixture, cooled down to 185&deg; Fah.
in 917 seconds. But when the same vessel was clothed with an equal
thickness of raw silk, water at the same heat and under the same
process required 1,264 seconds before it reached the same decrease
of temperature. It was also found by Sir Humphry Davy that even
metals became non-conductors when their cohesion was destroyed by
reducing them to the gaseous state.</p>

<p>It is now generally admitted that, heat being motion, anything,
which, by the cohesion of particles, preserves the continuity of
the molecular chain along which the motion is conveyed, must
augment calorific transmission. On the other hand, when there is a
division or disintegration of atoms, such as exists in sawdust,
powdered charcoal, furs, and felt, the particles composing such
bodies are separated from each other by spaces of air, which the
instructed among us well know are good non-conductors of heat. The
motion has, therefore, to pass from each particle of matter to the
air, and again from the air to the particle adjacent to it. Hence,
it will be readily seen, that in substances composed of separate or
divided particles, the thermal bridge, so to speak, is broken, and
the passage of heat is obstructed by innumerable barriers of
confined air. The correctness of these assumptions has been so
abundantly proved by experimental demonstrations, that every mind
that is tolerably informed on the subject must be relieved of every
shade of doubt respecting the greatly superior non-conducting
powers which bodies consisting of separate atoms possess over those
of a solid concrete nature.</p>

<p>The next matter of interest connected with the subject under
notice is its relation to the philosophy of radiation. It has long
been known that the emission of heat from a polished metallic
surface is very slight, but from a surface of porcelain, paper, or
charcoal, heat is discharged profusely. Even many of the best
non-conductors are powerful radiators, and throw off heat with a
repellent energy difficult to conceive.</p>

<p>"If two equal balls of thin, bright silver," says Sir John
Leslie, "one of them entirely uncovered and the other sheathed in a
case of cambric, be filled with water slightly warmed and then
suspended in a close room, the former will lose only eleven parts
in the same time that the latter will dissipate twenty parts." The
superior heat-retaining capacity which a clean tin kettle possesses
over one that has been allowed to collect smoke and soot, lies
within the compass of the most ordinary observation.</p>

<p>The experiments of the eminent philosopher just mentioned
furnish a variety of suggestions on the radiation from heated
surfaces. He found that, while the radiating power of clean lead
was only 19, it rose to 45 when tarnished by oxidation, that the
radiating power of plumbago was 75, and that of red lead 80. He
also discovered that, while the radiating power of gold, silver,
and polished tin was only 12, that of paper was 98, and lamp black
no less than 100. He further says: "A silver pot will emit scarcely
half as much heat as one of porcelain. The addition of a flannel,
though indeed a slow conductor, far from checking the dissipation
of heat, has directly a contrary tendency, for it presents to the
atmosphere a surface of much greater propulsive energy, which would
require a thickness of no less than three folds to
counterbalance."</p>

<p>It is safe to infer from this analogy that the felt covering of
boilers should not only be of considerable thickness, but should be
protected by an external jacketing of some sort; for, though felt
is a good non-conductor, it is a powerful absorber and radiator,
more especially when it has been allowed to contract soot and
dust.</p>

<p>Various experiments have lead to the general conclusion that the
power of absorption is always in the same proportion as the power
of radiation. It must be so. Were any substance a powerful radiator
and at the same time a bad absorber, it would necessarily radiate
faster than it would absorb, and its reduction of temperature would
continue without limit. It has, furthermore, been proved that the
absorptive property of substances increases as their reflecting
qualities diminish. Hence, the radiating power of a surface is
inversely as its reflecting power. It is for this reason that the
polished metallic sheathing on the cylinders of locomotive engines,
and on the boilers of steam fire engines, is not only ornamental
but essentially useful. Decisive tests have also established the
fact that radiation is effected more or less by color. "A black
porcelain tea pot," observes Dr. Lardner, "is the worst conceivable
material for that vessel, for both its material and color are good
radiators of heat, and the liquid contained in it cools with the
greatest possible rapidity; a polished silver or brass tea urn is
much better adapted to retain the heat of the water than one of a
dull brown, such as is most commonly used."</p>

<p>A few facts like those above stated afford more decisive
information regarding the nature of heat than columns of theory or
speculation. Yet it is rather strange that when so many learned and
reliable men have, experimented so much and commented with such
persuasiveness upon the subtile agency of heat and the vast amount
of waste that must accrue by injudicious management, comparatively
few have availed themselves of the united labors of these
indefatigable pyrologists; manufacturing owners and corporations
still persisting in having their steam boilers painted black or
dull red and leaving them exposed to the atmosphere. Some persons,
who pass themselves off very satisfactorily as clever engineers,
affect a contempt for the higher branches of science, and assert,
in a very positive and self-sufficient manner that experiments made
in a study or laboratory are on too trifling and small a scale to
be practically relied upon; that a tin kettle or a saucepan is a
very different thing to the boiler of a steam engine.</p>

<p>This may be so in one sense, but the same chemical forces which
operate upon the one will be just as active in a proportionate
degree in their action upon the other. It was said by Aristotle
that the laws of the universe are best observed in the most
insignificant objects; for the same physical causes which hold
together the stupendous frame of the universe may be recognized
even in a drop of rain. The same observation may be applied to the
laws of heat in all their ramifications; for, after all, our
experiments are, in many instances but defective copies of what is
continually going on in the great workshop of nature.</p>

<p>It would be needless to insist on the wasteful and destructive
effects produced by the exposure of boiler surfaces to the open
atmosphere. Such a practice can be neither supported by experience
nor justified by analogy; and it is to be hoped that it may before
long be consigned to the limbo of antiquated absurdities and be
satisfactorily forgotten. Seeing that it cannot with any show of
reason be affirmed that the boiler covering materials in present
use possess the requirements necessary to recommend them; the
question arises as to what is the best means of achieving the
object required. This is an inquiry which it is the office of time
alone to answer. As the problem is obviously one of primary
importance, and well worthy of the attention of inventors, it is
hazarding nothing to predict its satisfactory solution at no
distant date.</p>

<p>The plain truth is, boilers have of late become gigantic foes to
human life. Explosions have increased, are increasing, and should
be diminished; and they are, in many instances, caused by boilers
being strained and weakened by sudden contraction from having their
surfaces exposed when the fire has been withdrawn from them.
Boilers are also materially injured by the excessive furnace heat
which it is necessary to maintain to compensate for the large
amount of caloric which is dissipated from their surfaces, not only
by radiation but from absorption by the surrounding atmosphere.</p>

<p>As the views here laid down are drawn exclusively from the
region of fact and experiment, it is to be hoped that an
enlightened sense of self-interest may prompt those whom the
subject may concern, to give it that special attention which its
importance demands.</p>

<h2>Attachment of Saws to Swing-Frames.</h2>

<p>To insure the efficiency of mill-saws, it is highly important to
have them firmly secured in the frames by which they are
reciprocated. Swing-frames for carrying saws are ordinarily of
wrought iron or steel, and made up of several pieces mortised and
tenoned together in the form of a rectangular frame or
parallelogram, of which the longest sides are termed verticals and
the shortest crossheads or crossrails. In the case of deal frames,
the swing frame differs somewhat from that of a timber frame, in
having two extra verticals, which separate it into two equal
divisions. These are necessary in order that two deals may be
operated upon simultaneously, each division being devoted to a
separate deal, and likewise to enable the connecting-rod which
works the frame to pass up the center and oscillate on a pin near
the top, thereby avoiding the deep excavations and costly
foundations required where the rod is engaged with the pin at the
bottom. The rack that advances the deals to the saws passes through
a "bow" in the connecting-rod and the middle of the frame, the
deals are placed on either side of it, on rollers purposely
provided. In sawing hard deals, the saws require to be sharpened
about every tenth run or journey, and every twentieth for soft.
Fifty runs, or one hundred deals, are reckoned an average day's
work; this is inclusive of the time required for changing the saws,
returning the rack for another run, and other exigencies. For
attachment to swing-frames the saws have buckles riveted to them;
these are by various modes connected to the crossheads. Each top
buckle is passed through the crosshead and is pierced with a
mortise for the reception of a thin steel wedge or key, by whose
agency the blade is strained and tightened. The edge of the
crosshead upon which the keys bed is steeled to lessen the wear
invariably ensuing from frequently driving up the keys. The
distances between the blades are adjusted by interposing strips of
wood, or packing pieces, as they are termed, of equal thickness
with the required boards or leaves; the whole is then pressed
together and held in position by packing screws. The saws
themselves are subsequently tightened by forcing home the keys
until a certain amount of tension has been attained, this is
ascertained only by the peculiar sound which emanates from the
blade on being drawn considerably tight and tense. Great experience
is required to accustom the ear to the correct intonation, as in
general the tensile strain on the saws approximates so closely to
the breaking point that one or two extra taps on the keys are quite
sufficient to rupture them.</p>

<p>Mr. Brunel, in the government saw-mills at Woolwich, adopted a
method of hanging saws by means of a weighted lever, like a Roman
steelyard. A cross-shaft affixed above the saws to the cornice of
the main frame carried a lever, weighted at one end and provided
with a hook or shackle at the other for engagement with the saw
buckle. In using this apparatus the blades were strained one at a
time by linking the lever to the buckle and then adjusting the
movable weight until the desired tension was acquired, after which
the key was inserted into the mortise and the lever released. This
arrangement is not now in common use on account of the trouble
attending its employment, and at present the saws are merely
strained by hammering up the keys. The saw blades had usually a
tensile strain of upwards of one tun per inch of breadth of blade.
It is to be further observed that the cutting edges of the saws are
not quite perpendicular, but have a little lead, or their upper
ends overhang the lower about three eighths of an inch or one half
of an inch, according to the nature of the material to be sawn. The
object of this is that the saws may be withdrawn from the cuts in
the ascending or back stroke, and allow the sawdust free escape.
The eccentric actuating the mechanism for advancing the timber to
the saws is generally set in such a manner that the feed commences
just at the moment when the frame has attained half its ascending
stroke, and continues until the entire stroke has been completed.
By this regulation the saws are not liable to be suddenly choked,
but come smoothly and softly into their work.--<i>Worssam's

<h2>PATENT DECISION.</h2>

<p><i>In the matter of the application of William N. Bartholomew,
assignor to J. Reckendorfer, for letters patent for a design for
Rubber Eraser</i>--Letters patent for designs have increased in
importance within the past few years. Formerly but few were
granted, now many are issued. To this day they have made so little
figure in litigation that but three reported cases are known in
which design patents have come into controversy. With their
increase, questions have arisen concerning their scope and
character, which have given rise to dispute and to inquiry as to
the correctness of the current practice of the office in this
branch of invention. While on the one hand, it is insisted that the
practice has always been uniform, and is therefore now fixed and
definite; on the other, it is asserted, that there has never been,
and is not now, any well-defined or uniform practice, either in the
granting or refusal of design patents.</p>

<p>The act of 1836 made no provision for the patenting of designs.
The earliest legislation upon this subject is found in the act of
August 29, 1842, section 3; and the only legislation upon the
subject is found in this section and in section 11, of the act of
March 2, 1861. The definition of the subject matter, or, in other
words, of a "design," is the same in both acts. It is is
follows:</p>

<p>"That any citizen, etc., who, by his, her, or their own
industry, genius, efforts, and expense, may have invented or
produced any new and original design for a manufacture, whether of
metal or other material or materials, any original design for a
bust, statue, bas-relief, or composition in alto or basso-relievo,
or any new and original impression being formed in marble or other
material, or any new and useful pattern, or print, or picture, to
be either worked into or worked on, or printed, or painted, or
cast, or otherwise fixed on any article of manufacture, or any new
and original shape or configuration of any article of manufacture
not known or used by others, etc."</p>

<p>This definition embraces five particulars.</p>

<p>1. A new and original design for a manufacture.</p>

<p>2. An original design for a bust, statue, etc.</p>

<p>3. A new and original impression or ornament to be placed on any
article of manufacture.</p>

<p>4. A new and useful pattern, print, or picture to be worked into
or worked on, or printed, or painted, or cast, or otherwise fixed
on any article of manufacture.</p>

<p>5. A new and original shape or configuration of any article of
manufacture.</p>

<p>The first three of these classes would seem to refer to ornament
only; the fourth to ornament, combined with utility, as in the case
of trade marks; and the fifth to new shapes or forms of
manufactured articles, which, for some reason, were preferable to
those previously adopted.</p>

<p>The disputed questions which have thus far arisen under these
definitions are:</p>

<p>1. What variations may be claimed or covered by the patent
consistently with unity of design.</p>

<p>2. Is a new shape of an article of manufacture, whereby utility
is secured, a subject of protection under this act; and</p>

<p>3. Is mechanical function of any kind covered by it.</p>

<p>As to the first of these questions, it seems to have been
assumed that the design spoken of in all parts of the sections
referred to covered a fixed, unchangeable figure, that the
protection of letters patent did not extend to any variation,
however slight, but that such variation constituted a new design,
might be covered by a new patent, and might safely be used without
infringement of the first. This, it is said, is the correct theory
of the law, and has been the uniform adjudication of the
Office.</p>

<p>Neither of these statements is absolutely correct. The law by no
means defines a design with such strictness. The language is, "new
and original design for a manufacture," "new and original
impression or ornament," "new and original shape or configuration."
It would seem to be too plain for argument, that the new design, or
impression, or shape, might be so generic in its character as to
admit of many variations, which should embody the substantial
characteristics and be entirely consistent with a substantial
identity of form. Thus, if the invention were of a design for an
ornamental button, the face of which was grooved with radial rays,
it would seem that the first designer of such a button might
properly describe a button of five rays, and, having stated that a
greater number of rays might be used, might claim a design
consisting generally of radial rays, or of "five or more" rays,
and, that it could not be necessary for him to take out a patent
for each additional ray that could be cut upon his button. So, if
the design were the ornamentation of long combs by a chain of
pearls, it would seem that a claim for such a design might be
maintained against one who arranged the pearls, either in curved or
straight lines, or who used half pearls only, and that such
modifications if they had occurred to the designer, might properly
have been enumerated in his specification as possible and
equivalent variations. In short, I can see no reason, under the
law, why designs may not be generic, why what are called "broad
claims," may not be made to them, and why the doctrine of artistic
or aesthetic equivalents may not be applied to them.</p>

<p>This has been recognized to a greater or less extent in the
adjudications of the courts and in the practice of the Office.</p>

<p>One of the reported cases is that of Booth <i>vs</i>. Garelly 1,
Blatch 247. The design is described as consisting of "radially
formed ornaments on the face of the molds or blocks of which the
button is formed, combined with the mode of winding the covering on
the same, substantially as set forth, whether the covering be of
one or more colors." The specification, in "substantially" setting
forth the design, contained this language: "It will be obvious from
the foregoing that the figures can be changed at pleasure by giving
the desired form to the face of the mold by depressions and
elevations which radiate from a point, whether in the center of the
mold or eccentric thereto."</p>

<p>In the consideration of the case by the Court no objection was
made to this statement or claim. In the case of Root <i>vs</i>.
Ball, 4 McLean 180, the learned judge instructed the jury that "if
they should find that the defendants had infringed the plaintiff's
patent by using substantially the same device as ornamental on the
same part of the stove they would, of course, find the defendant
guilty. To infringe a patent right it is not necessary that the
thing patented should be adopted in every particular; but if, as in
the present case, the design and figures were substantially adopted
by the defendants, they have infringed the plaintiff's right. If
they adopt the same principle the defendants are guilty. The
principle of a machine is that combination of mechanical powers
which produce a certain result. And in a case like the present,
where ornaments are used for a stove, it is an infringement to
adopt the design so as to produce substantially the same
appearance."</p>

<p>It has been the constant practice to grant patents for designs
for fonts of type, for sets of silver plate, for a series of
printers' flourishes, and the like. This class of cases has always
passed without objection.</p>

<p>Two other cases which have arisen within the Office deserve
notive. The first was for a series of miniature shoulder straps,
with emblems denoting rank, provided with a pin, to be worn under
an officer's coat, upon his vest, or as a lady's breastpin. The
drawing shows eight of these pins with emblems of rank, varying
from that of second lieutenant to major-general, specification
describing the brooch for a second lieutenant goes on to say: "I
propose to introduce, on some of them, the different ornaments
showing the respective ranks of the army, from a major-generalship
to a second lieutenancy. See Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8."</p>

<p>The second case was that of an application for a monogram
visiting card, on which the name was to be inscribed or printed in
the form of a monogram. The applicant filed a drawing, showing a
card upon which was a monogram of his own name. In his
specification he gives certain rules for forming such monograms,
and then says: "It is manifest that the form of the letters as well
as the letters themselves can be changed as required by
circumstances or the taste of the individual for whom the monogram
is designed; and that the general form and outline of the monogram
may be varied; and indeed, must vary to be adapted to the
particular name it is required to represent."</p>

<p>The claim was for "a monogram, visiting card, or visiting card
upon which the name is inscribed or printed in the form of a
monogram, substantially as herein specified."</p>

<p>This application was rejected by the Examiner and Board of
Examiners-in-Chief, but was allowed by the Commissioner upon
appeal.</p>

<p>It is true that, before and since this patent was issued, many
patents have been refused for what I have called generic designs.
One man having designed a tack head, ornamented with radial lines,
was compelled to take out one patent for his tack with six radial
lines, and another for the same tack with eight. There are other
instances of like character, but they only serve to show that the
practice of the Office has not been uniform, and that the true
practice is still to be adopted and followed.</p>

<p>I have no hesitation in saying, in view of the premises, that a
valid patent may be granted for a new genus or class of ornaments
as well as for specific ornaments, though I do not doubt that,
under the statute, every species, variety, and individual having
distinct characteristics under such a genus might also be patented,
the patent being subordinate and tributary to that which covered
the class. From the nature of this subject-matter there must always
be more latitude in the issue of patents for trifling changes, or
form, or outline, since it is only necessary that such changes
should constitute a new "design" to entitle them to a patent of
this class.</p>

<p>The second question relates to the elements of utility in
patents for designs.</p>

<p>Upon this point, it is said by my predecessor, in Jason Crane
<i>ex parte</i> Commissioners, December-May, 1869, p. 1, that the
construction which has been given to the act of 1842, by the
Office, ever since its passage, is that it relates to designs for
ornament merely; something of an artistic character as
contradistinguished to those of convenience or utility.</p>

<p>The Board of Examiners-in-Chief, in the present case, say "The
practice of the Office has been uniform from the beginning, and has
always excluded cases like the present from the benefit of the laws
relating to designs." And, again, "The general understanding has
always been that the acts of 1842 and 1861 were intended to cover
articles making pretensions to artistic excellence
exclusively."</p>

<p>In thus denying that a new "shape or configuration" of an
article, whereby utility or convenience is promoted, is the proper
subject of a patent under the acts referred to, the Office would
seem to have involved itself in the absurdity that if a design is
useless it may be patented; whereas, if it be useful, it is
entitled to no protection.</p>

<p>Fortunately no such "uniform practice" has existed, and the
Office is relieved from so grievous an imputation. The practice
seems to have been taken for granted by the appellate tribunals,
and, so far from being as stated, is, as nearly as possible, the
reverse of it. Articles have been, and are being, constantly
patented as designs which possess no element of the artistic or
ornamental, but are valuable solely because, by a new shape or
configuration, they possess more utility than the prior forms of
like articles Of this character are designs for ax heads, for
reflectors, for lamp shades, for the soles of boots and shoes,
which have been heretofore patented as designs, and to this class
might be added, with great propriety, that class of so-called
"mechanical" patents, granted for mere changes of form, such as
plowshares, fan blowers, propeller blades, and others of like
character.</p>

<p>When, therefore, my learned predecessor in Crane's case added to
this number a box so designed as to hold with convenience a set of
furs, he did but confirm and not alter the practice of the Office,
so far as it can be gleaned from the patented cases. I am of
opinion that the class of cases named in the act as arising from
"new shape or configuration" includes within it all those mere
changes of form which involve increase of utility. This I take to
be the spirit of the decision in Wooster <i>vs</i>. Crane, 2 Fisher
583. The design was of a reel in the shape of a rhombus. The
learned Judge says "In this case, the reel itself, as an article of
manufacture, is conceded to be old and not the subject of a patent.
The shape applied to it by the complainant is also an old,
well-known mathematical figure. Now although it does not appear
that any person ever before applied this particular shape to this
particular article, I cannot think that the act quoted above was
intended to secure to the complainant an exclusive right to use
this well known figure in the manufacture of reels. The act,
although it does not require utility in order to secure the benefit
of its provisions, does require that the shape produced shall be
the result of industry, effort genius, or expense, and must also, I
think, be held to require that the shape or configuration sought to
be secured shall, at least, be new and original as applied to
articles of manufacture. But here the shape is a common one in many
articles of manufacture, and its application to a reel cannot
fairly be said to be the result of industry, genius, effort, and
expense. No advantage whatever is pretended to be derived from the
adoption of the form selected by the complainant, except the
incidental one of using it as a trademark. Its selection can hardly
be said to be the result of effort even; it was simply an arbitrary
chance selection of one of many well-known shapes, all equally well
adapted to the purpose. To hold that such an application of a
common form can be secured by letters patent, would be giving the
act of 1861 a construction broader than I am willing to give
it"</p>

<p>It would seem from this language that if there had been
"advantage," that is, utility in the adoption of the form of the
rhombus, that it would have found more favor in the eyes of the
Court.</p>

<p>This subject has been well discussed in the opinion of
Commissioner Foote in Crane <i>ex parte</i>. I concur in that
opinion, except as to the recital of the former practice of the
Office, which a careful examination has shown to be erroneous.</p>

<p>The third question may be readily disposed of. Modes of
operation or construction, principles of action, combinations to
secure novelty or utility of movement, or compositions of matter,
can hardly be said to be "shapes, configurations, or designs," but
where the sole utility of the new device arises from its new shape
or configuration, I think it may fairly be included among the
subjects which the act of 1842 was designed to protect.</p>

<p>The present case may, in view of the foregoing consideration, be
disposed of without difficulty. Letters patent are asked, by
applicant, for a new design for a rubber eraser, which consists in
giving to the eraser a cylindrical body, with ends beveled to an
edge. The claim is for the "cylindrical rubber eraser provided with
a wrapper or case, as herein shown and described"</p>

<p>In the body of the specification the applicant describes the
mode of making the eraser, and he also enumerates its advantages
over erasers of the ordinary forms.</p>

<p>The Examiner does not object to the application because of the
utility of the eraser, although the Board of Examiners in Chief
seem to base their decision upon that point alone, but he
pronounces the form already old in its application to artists'
stumps, and he insists that the mode of composition or construction
can form no element, for the claim for a design patent.</p>

<p>In the latter statement he is undoubtedly right. These patents
are granted solely for new shapes or forms, and the form being new
it is immaterial by what process that form is attained. The
composition of matter or the mode of construction is neither
"design," "shape," nor "configuration," and must be protected, if
at all, under a patent of another kind. I cannot say that the
presence of such matter in the specification would be objectionable
if description merely, but it could in no way be allowed to enter
into, or to modify the claim.</p>

<p>As to the first ground of rejection, I think the Examiner is in
error. This purports to be a new form or shape of a distinct
article of manufacture, to wit: rubber erasers. If it be new, as
thus applied, it is immaterial whether pencils, or stumps, or pen
holders, or anything else may or may not have been made
cylindrical. If they are not substantially the same article of
manufacture as erasers, the old form applied to this new article is
unquestionably entitled to protection.</p>

<p>The applicant has not defined his invention with entire
accuracy. He should strike from his claim the words "provided with
a wrapper or case," as those relate to construction and not
configuration, and he should insert the words "having the ends
beveled to an edge" in lieu of the phrase erased, or he should
adopt the usual form of claim for designs, viz: "The design for a
rubber eraser, as shown and described."</p>

<p>As the claim stands, it ought not to be allowed, and the
decision must be affirmed, but the applicant will be allowed to
amend as suggested.</p>

<h2>Russ' Improved Wood Molding Machine.</h2>

<p>A comprehensive description of this excellent machine was given
upon page 230, Vol. XVIII., of the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN. We now
present our readers with an engraving of it and a summary of its
important features, which doubtless render it equal if not superior
to any machine of the kind in market. The frame in which the feed
rollers are arranged is so hung to the frame-work of the molding
machine, that it can be raised or lowered at pleasure, in order to
properly adjust the feed rollers for action upon the "stuff," and
it is also so constructed as to permit the feed rollers to yield in
case of variations in the thickness of the "stuff" passing under
them. The spindle of the side cutter-heads is hung in a vertical
frame arranged to be moved up and down, and laterally, to adjust
the cutter-head for action, and is provided at its upper end with a
box or bearing, whereby the bearing of the box is always kept upon
the spindle instead of at different points of the same as in other
machines, and this without interfering with the adjustability of

<p>The bed of the machine is formed with a series of slots or
openings provided with bridge bars so that the cutters may act upon
the edges of the stuff without danger of injury from striking the
bed. The presser shoe is also made adjustable for different
thicknesses of the "stuff" and self-yielding to variations in
thickness, by a peculiar method of hanging the bar, which carries
the presser shoe, to the framework of the machine.</p>

<p>The clamp which holds the press block which acts upon the
"stuff" after it has passed through the cutter, is of novel
construction, and the spindle of the side cutter-heads is so
arranged in connection with a loose pulley and the pulley-drums,
that both cutter-heads are driven by one belt and in the same
direction.</p>

<p>The bed plate is provided with springs through which the side
cutter-heads are arranged, to move laterally or transversely with a
bridge-plate or plates, susceptible of adjustment independent of
the cutter-heads, whereby an adjustable support to the "stuff" is
given as it passes over the line of the openings in the bed.</p>

<p>Most machines have weighted pressure feed, but this having steel
springs adjustable by a screw and hand wheel, a heavy or light
pressure can be applied according to the work done or size of
molding. The cutter-heads are square and slotted so that any style
of molding can be stuck by putting cutters on all sides of the
head, thus equalizing the cost and lessening the power. The
pressure shoe is arranged to hold the "stuff" at the very point of
contact with the cutters, and, as we have shown, is readily
adjusted to a long or short cutter, so that a small molding can be
made as smooth as a large one, and so as not to require any
finishing with sandpaper or a hand tool.</p>

<p>The machine has also a bevel track very useful for picture frame
molding, and a patent cap of great value for the cutters, and
readily applied to any slotted head or common head. The wrenches
that go with the machine, and the common malleable iron caps for
the top cylinder, are shown in detail. These machines are now
running in Worcester, Boston, and Fitchburg, Mass.; Chicago, Ill.:
Philadelphia, Pa.; Brattleboro, Vt.; Whitesboro, N. Y.; Charleston,
S. C., and other places, and, it is claimed, are capable of doing
better work and more of it than any machine now in use.</p>

<p>This machine is covered by several patents taken through the
Scientific American Patent Agency. It is manufactured by R. Ball
&amp; Co., of Worcester, Mass, to whom write for further
information.</p>

<h2>A Lost Civilization.</h2>

<p>At the last regular meeting of the American Geographical and
Statistical Society at its rooms in the Cooper Institute, Professor
Newberry, of Columbia College, delivered an address on the subject
of his explorations in Utah and Arizona Territories. The speaker
commenced by giving a short history of the circumstances under
which the two government expeditions to which he was attached were
organized. He then confined his remarks to the subject of the
latter expedition, no account of which has yet been published. Its
aim was principally to explore the region embraced by what is known
as the old Spanish trail from Santa Fe to California. After giving
an interesting account of the topography of the region traversed,
he proceeded to speak of the traces which were found on every hand
of a former occupancy by a numerous population now extinct. These
were most numerous near the course of the San Juan river. There
were found ruins of immense structures, a view of one of which he
exhibited, built regularly of bricks, a foot in thickness, and
about eighteen inches in length, with the joints properly broken,
and as regularly laid and as smooth as any in a Fifth Avenue
mansion. This structure he said was as large as the Croton
reservoir. Inside were rooms nicely plastered as the walls of a
modern house. There were also traces of extensive canals, which had
been constructed to bring water to these towns, which were received
into large cisterns. The lecturer also exhibited pieces of pottery
which he said abounded everywhere, showing that in a former age all
this vast region had been inhabited. He gave it as his opinion that
the depopulation of this region was attributable to the fact that
both to the north and the south were warlike hordes, and from the
incursions of one and the other of these, the peaceable Aztecs, who
had been the former denizens of the country, had been gradually
wiped out. The only people left here now were the Mokies, who lived
in towns inclosed within high, thick walls, and who were almost
inaccessible. These people were visited, and the explorers were
received by them with great hospitality. The speaker concluded by
giving a short account of the manners of the people and their
customs, as far as an opportunity was had to observe them.</p>

<h2>GIRARD'S "PALIER GLISSANT."</h2>

<p>The term "<i>palier glissant</i>," which does not admit of being
very happily translated into an English term of equal brevity, is
the name given by the inventor, Mr. Girard, to a frictionless
support, or socket, designed to sustain the axes of heavy wheels in
machinery. Since it is a contrivance deriving its efficacy from
hydraulic pressure, it may, without impropriety, be considered
here. The friction of axles in their supports is the occasion of a
considerable loss of power in every machine.</p>

<p class="ctr"><img src="images/6b.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The loss of power itself, though a real disadvantage, is
nevertheless a matter of secondary consequence compared with the
attendant elevation of temperature, which, were not means carefully
provided for reducing friction to the lowest point possible, might
soon be so great as to arrest the operation of the machine itself.
It was stated in a public lecture delivered in May, 1867, before
the Scientific Association of France, that, in a certain instance
within the lecturer's knowledge, the screw shaft of a French naval
propeller became absolutely welded to its support, though
surrounded by the water of the sea, in consequence of the great
heat developed by its revolution.</p>

<p>The ordinary means of reducing friction is to apply oil, or some
other unctuous substance, to the parts which move upon each other.
Some disadvantages attend this expedient, but till a better is
suggested they have to be endured. The cost of the oil expended in
maintaining in proper condition the axles of the machinery in a
foundery, or of the rolling stock of a railroad, amounts to a large
sum annually; while the want of neatness which its use makes, to a
certain extent, inevitable, and the labor which must be constantly
employed to prevent this want of neatness from becoming much
greater than it is, are serious items to be set off against its
positive usefulness.</p>

<p>The object of Mr. Girard is to get rid of all these drawbacks by
the simple expedient of substituting water for oil. It would not
avail to apply water precisely as oil is applied. Though any one's
experience may tell him that two smooth pieces of metal will slide
more smoothly on each other when they are wet than when they are
dry, yet every one knows also that oil facilitates the movement
much more perceptibly than water; and also, that in the case of oil
there is no difficulty in maintaining the lubricating film, whereas
water easily evaporates, and in case of the accident of even a
moderate elevation of temperature, it would be expelled from the
joint entirely. Mr. Girard proposes, therefore, to employ the water
to act, first, by its pressure, to lift the Journal to be
lubricated; and secondly, by its fluidity, to form a liquid bed or
cushion between the journal and its box, on which the journal may
rest in its revolution, without touching the metal of the box at
all.</p>

<p>The construction will be understood by referring to the figure.
One of the journals is represented as removed, and in the
cylindrical surface of the socket are seen grooves occupying a
considerable part of the area exposed. These grooves communicate,
by an aperture in the middle, with a tube which is represented
externally, and which sends a branch to the other journal, through
which water under a heavy pressure is introduced into the box
beneath the journal. The effect of the hydraulic pressure is to
lift the axle, opening a passage for the escape of the compressed
water, which at the same time, because of its release from
compression, loses the power to sustain the weight. If, therefore,
by the first impulse, the axle is thrown upward to any sensible
distance, it will immediately fall back again, once more confining
more or less completely the water. After one or two oscillations,
therefore, the axle will settle itself at length in a position in
which, while the water will escape, it will escape but as a film of
inappreciable thickness. In this condition the journal turns upon a
liquid bed, and the resistance to its revolution is so excessively
small that a slow rotation given by hand to a wheel sustained by it
will be maintained for many minutes without perceptible
retardation. In fact, the most striking illustration which can be
given of the immense superiority of the <i>palier glissant</i> over
a support lubricated in in any other way, is furnished by placing
two precisely similar wheels or disks side by side, weighing five
or six pounds each, with a diameter of seven or eight inches, and
journals of half an inch in diameter; one of them furnished with
<i>paliers glissants</i>, and the other with boxes lubricated with
fine oil. Give each of them a velocity of rotation of about one
revolution in a second; the one lubricated with oil will come to
rest before the other begins to give evidence of any sensible
retardation; but if at any moment the stop-cock which supplies the
water to the second be turned, this one will also stop, and its
stopping will be instantaneous.</p>

<p>It might be supposed that a journal supported in the manner
above described would be unsteady and liable to injurious
vibrations. This is not the case, and it is easy to see why not.
When the journal is truly in the middle of the socket, that is to
say when there is an equal distance between it and the wall of the
socket on either side, it will be equally pressed from both sides.
But if it is in the least displaced laterally, the pressure on the
side toward which it moves will instantly increase, while that on
the other side will correspondingly diminish: both causes
transpiring to resist the displacement, and to maintain the journal
in the position of true equilibrium.</p>

<p>The water pressure by which these "slippery supports" are
supplied must be created by a force pump worked by the machine
itself. The reservoir need not be large as the expenditure of water
is very minute in volume. To the objection which may naturally be
made, that the working of the pump must be a tax on the motive
power without return, a reply at once simple and satisfactory is
found in the experience of Mr. Girard, that the working of the pump
does not consume so much as half, and sometimes not more than one
one quarter, of the power which is lost in friction when the
ordinary modes of lubrication are employed; so that by the adoption
of this expedient the available power of the machine is very
sensibly increased after deducting all that is expended in the
performance of this additional work.</p>

<p>BEES BENEFICIAL TO FRUIT.--Dr. A. Packard, editor of the
<i>American Naturalist</i>, replies to a query in regard to the
effects produced upon fruit by the agency of honey bees, that all
the evidence given by botanists and zoologists who have specially
studied the subject, shows that bees improve the quality and tend
to increase the quantity of fruit. They aid in the fertilization of
flowers, thus preventing the occurrence of sterile flowers, and, by
more thoroughly fertilizing flowers already perfect, render the
production of sound and well developed fruit more sure. Many
botanists think if it were not for bees, and other insects, many
plants would not bear fruit at all.</p>

<p>Steamboats on the American plan are to be introduced on Lake
Geneva, Switzerland. This will add very greatly to the comfort and
pleasure of tourists on that beautiful lake.</p>

<h2>A HAPPY NEW YEAR!</h2>

<p>Is the heartfelt wish conveyed in this beautiful and unusually
large number, to each and all of our friends and readers This
holiday number is worthy of note not only on account of its size,
its rich table of contents, and profuse illustrations, but because
we publish this week the largest edition ever sent out from this
office.</p>

<p>Our readers may be surprised at our publishing the title page of
the volume again this week but they will please observe it is the
title page of Vol XXII, which we are now commencing The title pages
will hereafter be published with the first instead of the last
number of each volume, so as to bring it in its proper place for
binding.</p>

<p>Subscriptions are pouring in from all parts of the country in
the most encouraging manner. Many have already secured the prize
engraving, by sending in the requisite number of names-but we feel
obliged to confess that there is now a considerable want of
vitality in the competition for the cash prizes. We expect however,
that as soon as the new year's greetings are fairly exchanged, that
this opportunity to receive some purse money will attract the
attention of our enterprising readers The times may be a little
close just now, but we are confident that the spring will open
joyously, and we are quite sure that the people will still want to
know what is going on in the GREAT WORLD OF INDUSTRY, which, it
will be our duty to chronicle.</p>

<p>All lists intended to compete for the cash premium must be

<h2>THE SUEZ CANAL NOT YET A FAILURE.</h2>

<p>The daily press is giving currency to a great many facts in
regard to the present incomplete condition of the Suez Canal, and
some journals are arguing therefrom that it is a failure. As yet,
ships of heavy draft are unable to get through it. Some disasters
to shipping have occurred in the Red Sea after the canal has been
passed, and it is not at all improbable that more troubles will
arise before everything goes smoothly.</p>

<p>The Red Sea is comparatively unknown to navigators. It contains
hidden rocks which must be charted and buoyed before its navigation
can be rendered safe. Surely this ought not to take the world by
surprise. As to the canal itself, we are only surprised that it has
reached its present state of perfection and we advise those who now
make haste to prophesy ignominious defeat for one of the greatest
enterprises of the century, to suspend judgment for a time. New
York journalists might certainly call to mind with profit, the
annual troubles attending the opening of the canals in this State.
Frosts heave and rats undermine, and banks annually give way, yet
these things are not regarded as surprising. But upon the opening
of a work, to which all the minor canals in the world are like the
rods of the magicians to Aaron's rod which swallowed them up, it is
expected that everything shall move without difficulty, and that no
oversight will have been committed. Truly this would be to
attribute a power of prevision to M. Lesseps beyond what is human.
The world can afford to wait a little till this huge machine gets
oiled. Great enterprises move slow at the outset. We have yet
unshaken faith in the ultimate success of the Suez Canal.</p>

<h2>TUBULAR BOILERS AND BOILER EXPLOSIONS.</h2>

<p>In our description of the novel steam boiler, published on page
209, last volume, we made a quotation from several eminent writers
and experimenters on the subjects of heat and steam, to the effect
that the tubular system in steam boilers was wrong in theory and
unsafe in practice, and although this system has hitherto been
extensively used on account of some advantages which it secures, it
has long been a serious question with thinking men whether these
advantages were not obtained at too dear a rate.</p>

<p>While not prepared to admit all the force of the objections made
to the tubular system, there are arguments against it that it will
not do to treat lightly and which seem to us more and more forcible
the more we candidly reflect upon the subject. One of the most
forcible of these which occurs to us is, that in the tubular system
the disruptive force of unequal expansion is far more likely to
become a cause of danger than in the plain cylinder boiler. In such
boilers the tension of expanded tubes is transmitted to the shell,
which are greatly strained without doubt, often nearly to the verge
of rupture. When this occurs it is evident an unusual strain,
caused by sudden generation of steam, would act in concert with the
expansion of the tubes, and we have no doubt these causes combined
have given rise to many an explosion when the steam, acting singly,
could never have produced rupture.</p>

<p>But while we give due weight to this argument, there is one
often referred to by our correspondents, and which we often see
stated in newspapers, as ridiculous as the one we have noticed is
forcible. It is that when, in such boilers, water, by carelessness
or otherwise, is allowed to fall below any of the tubes, the steam
which surrounds them is decomposed, and becomes an explosive
mixture of hydrogen and oxygen gases, ready to explode with
terrible violence whenever the temperature of the tubes shall have
reached the proper point.</p>

<p>This argument is ridiculous, because it rests on no experimental
basis. It is a flimsy theory, entirely unsupported by any facts.
Never has it been proved that hot iron, at any temperature likely
to be obtained in steam boiler tubes, decomposes steam except by
itself appropriating the oxygen of the steam, and leaving the
hydrogen, by itself no more explosive than any other heated
gas.</p>

<p>The sole object of the tubular boiler is to increase the heating
surface, without corresponding increase in other particulars. That
it is not the only means whereby this object can be secured has
already been demonstrated and we believe will hereafter be shown in
divers ways. We have no more doubt that the next fifty years will
witness the total abandonment of the tubular system, than we have
that the world will last that length of time.</p>

<h2>AMERICAN RAILWAY MANAGEMENT.</h2>

<p>There seems a growing opinion among railway managers that the
sole end and purpose of a railroad is to line the 6 pockets of, if
not its stockholders, at least its directors. In fact we not long
since saw a statement in a widely-circulated journal, that, as the
sole purpose of railroads is that the companies who own them should
make money, it is absurd to suppose they would be content to manage
them in any way whereby such a result would not be most likely to
accrue.</p>

<p>The journal referred to, in making this statement a basis for an
argument in favor of railway consolidation, entirely ignored the
rights of the public from which railway corporations have obtained
their charters. In these charters certain privileges were granted,
not out of pure generosity, but with the understanding that certain
benefits were to accrue to the public. Its safety and convenience
were to be considered as well as the profits to the owners.</p>

<p>Every charter granted to these roads involves a contract on
their part to do the public a certain service, and in a large
majority of cases these contracts are to-day unfulfilled. Day after
day sees the power to control more and more centered in a few
unscrupulous wily managers, and the comfort and safety of
passengers more and more disregarded; yet still the people
submit.</p>

<p>But they do not submit without complaint. Now and then a
newspaper correspondent grumbles, and the news of smashes that may
be almost daily seen in the papers gives a text for an occasional
editorial blast, as little heeded by the delinquent companies, as a
zephyr is felt by an oak.</p>

<p>Thus the New York <i>Times</i>, on the occasion of a recent
railway disaster, gives vent to a little mild denunciation. It
says:</p>

<p>"The general rule in this country (to which there are indeed
exceptions) in regard to the purchase of railway materials is
simply this: buy the cheapest. First cost is the controlling and
often the only question entertained. The nature of the materials
and processes to be used in the manufacture of rails, for instance,
are not mentioned. The buyers for some of our roads, especially new
roads, never make the slightest allusion to quality, and never
specify tests and inspections, but simply go about among the mills,
comparing and beating down prices, and accepting the very lowest.
More than one of our rail makers are to-day rolling, under protest,
rails upon which they decline to put their trade-mark--rails made
from the very cheapest materials, in the very meanest manner--for
all that is required is that they shall stick together till they
are laid. And if American makers will not roll them, Welsh makers
will. The late report of the State Engineer of New York says:
'American railway managers, instead of offering anything like a
reasonable price for good iron rails, have made themselves
notorious by establishing as standard, a brand of rails known all
over the world as "American rails," which are confessedly bought
and sold as the weakest, most impure, least worked, least durable,
and cheapest rails that can be produced.' The State Engineer
refers, in confirmation of this opinion, to the statement of Mr.
A.S. Hewitt, United States Commissioner to the Paris Exposition, a
statement not yet controverted; and to a statement of Mr. Sandberg,
an English engineer of note, in the London <i>Times</i>. A leading
American railway president and reformer has publicly said: 'There
is a fear on my part that railway companies will themselves tempt
steel makers to send a poor article by buying the cheapest--first
cost only considered--<i>as they did with the
ironmasters</i>.'"</p>

<p>This certainly is a blessed state of affairs. We have given
privileges to giant corporations, which they have improved so
profitably, that they now can defeat, in our Legislatures, any
attempt to revoke them, and can laugh at any demand for better
management.</p>

<p>Disguise it how we may, the railroads have got the upper hand of
the people, and they seem likely to keep it, unless, indeed, their
rapacity shall react against themselves.</p>

<p>At the moment of this writing accounts reach us of the officers
of a prominent railway line intrenching themselves against the
officers of the law, and employing force to resist the service of
precepts calling them to account for alleged frauds upon the
stockholders.</p>

<p>That the Legislature of this State has the power to put a stop
to these disgraceful proceedings, is certain; what it will do
remains to be demonstrated.</p>

<h2>THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE PRIZES AWARDED TO STEAM ENGINES.</h2>

<p>If there is anybody satisfied with the action of the managers of
the American Institute, in the matter of awarding prizes to the
competing engines exhibited at the recent fair, we have yet to meet
that complacent individual. Neither the exhibitors nor the general
public could be expected to accept with equanimity such a report as
the managers have made, because it is inadequate to give any real
idea of the relative merits of the engines tested. The exhibitors,
at a large expense, took their engines to the hall of exhibition,
placed them in position, and with them drove the machinery
exhibited there; and now, when in return they had a right to expect
a decided, manly course on the part of the managers, the oyster is
swallowed and the contestants are each politely handed a shell.</p>

<p>The conditions on which the general test was to be made
contained, among other specifications, these: that "the water
supplied to and evaporated in the boiler will be measured by means
of a meter, and the coal burned may also be weighed."</p>

<p>Only one of the conditions quoted was properly complied with.
The coal was weighed, but though a meter was used to measure the
water, tests made, we are informed, <i>after the trial of the
engines</i>, showed that the meter was so inaccurate as to
completely invalidate any calculation based upon its record of the
water supplied. Nevertheless this has, we are credibly informed,
been made the basis of calculation; and the amount of coal consumed
during each trial has been rejected either as a basis of
calculation or a check on the inaccuracy of the meter.</p>

<p>Other prescribed regulations were observed with great care. The
engines were indicated in a masterly manner by a gentleman of great
experience, as the cards--tracings of which we have seen--bear
ample testimony. The temperature of the feedwater was 47 degrees;
it should, in our opinion, have been heated, but we waive this
point. The state of the barometer and temperatures of engine room
and fire-room were observed; but we respectfully submit, that with
coal consumption left out of the calculation, and the water
consumption an unascertained quantity, the question of relative
economy, the vital point to be settled, is as uncertain today as it
was before the test.</p>

<p>In the <i>Tribune</i> of December 20, appeared a statement of
the test to ascertain the accuracy of the meter used, which showed
that in an aggregate of twelve tests it varied nearly three per
cent in its record from the actual quantity delivered, while at
times it was so erratic that it varied in one instance over <i>ten
per cent</i>.</p>

<p>Truly, considered in connection with this fundamental error,
temperatures of engine and boiler rooms, and states of barometer,
will not count for much with engineers.</p>

<p>An oversight like this would, however, never have been laid at
the door of the managers, however it might invalidate the test; but
when the utterly absurd decision announced in the papers, after a
tedious delay had led the public to expect an exhaustive statement,
gave rise to general disappointment and excited the utmost
dissatisfaction, it became manifest that a manly, straightforward
course on their part was not to be hoped for, and that any protest
against the consummation of the farce would be vain.</p>

<p>It is not for us to decide on the merits of the engines
submitted to test. It was for the judges to do this. We maintain
that nothing that the public will accept as a decision has been
reached, and on behalf of the public we protest that the managers
have not only placed themselves in a very unenviable position by
their action in the premises, but have done a lasting injury to the
American Institute, the results of which will be disastrously felt
in future exhibitions.</p>

<p>The studied ambiguity of the report which awards two first
prizes to the competing engines, is no less apparent than the
desire to shun responsibility.</p>

<h2>A PROTEST AGAINST THE CANADIAN PATENT LAW.</h2>

<p>In July, 1869, the New Dominion Patent Law went into operation,
but it has not yet been approved by the Queen, and if rejected the
Canadian Parliament will perhaps try its hand again. Although
Canadians may freely go to all parts of the world and take out
patents for their inventions, they have always manifested a mean
spirit and adopted a narrow policy, in reference to inventors of
other nations. Their present patent laws are so framed as
practically to debar all persons except Canadians from taking
patents; and the result is that American and English inventions are
pirated and patented in the Dominion, without so much as a "thank
you, sir," to the <i>bona fide</i> originators.</p>

<p>A protest has been presented to her Majesty's Secretary of State
for the Colonies, asking that the new law may be rejected, on the
ground that it deprives the subjects of the Crown of their equal
rights throughout the empire. There is force in this objection, and
Lord Granville has promised that it shall be duly considered before
the Queen is advised to sign the law.</p>

<p>The probable result will be a revision of the Dominion patent
code so as to let in Englishmen but exclude the Yankees, from whom
the Canadians derive whatever of improvement, progress, and energy
they possess.</p>

<h2>THE BRIGHTER SIDE.</h2>

<p>Ingratitude seldom enters into the composition of a true
inventor, and nothing in our business career has afforded us more
pleasure than the frequent letters addressed to us by those who
have, during more than twenty years, employed the Scientific
American Patent Agency. We cannot find room for all the pleasant
missives that come to us from our extensive list of clients, but we
may give a few as samples of the many.</p>

<p>Mr. Daniel J. Gale, of Sheboygan, Wis., has recently secured
through our Agency Letters Patent for a "Perpetual and Lunar
Calendar Clock." In the fullness of his satisfaction he thus
writes: "The fact is, I shall never be able to thank you
sufficiently for what you have done for me. I sent you a copy of
the paper printed here, which favorably notices my improvement and
your great Agency. The fees charged me for my patent have been low
enough. Already, by one of my own townsmen, I have been offered
$4,000 for my interest in the patent. But I must not take up too
much of your I time. Please allow me to add that I regularly
receive your valuable paper, the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, and that you
may number me as one of its stanch friends."</p>

<p>Mr. Edwin Norton, of Brooklyn, N.Y., in a recent note, says:
"Allow me to express my thanks for the promptness and efficiency
with which the business of obtaining a patent for my 'Cinder and
Dust Arrester' has been conducted through your Agency--and not only
in this case but in several previous ones. This is the
<i>fourth</i> patent obtained by me through four Agency within nine
months. It gives me pleasure to add my testimony to that of many
others, with respect to the very satisfactory manner in which your
Patent Agency is conducted."</p>

<p>Mr. E. J. Marstens says, in reference to his improved "Field
Press"--"I find everything correct. You certainly accomplished more
than I expected after the first examination by the Primary
Examiner. I hope soon to be able to give you another case."</p>

<p>Mr. S. P. Williams, an old client, writes as follows: "I
received the patent on my 'Trace Lock for Whiffletrees,' and I am
truly pleased with the prompt manner in which you have done the
business. It is only a few weeks since I made the application, and
I expected that it would be as many months before the patent could
be granted."</p>

<h2>PROFESSOR FISKE'S LECTURES AT HARVARD.</h2>

<p>It certainly argues well for the intellectual character of the
readers of the New York <i>World</i> that during the prevalent
taste for sensational journalism, it has found the publication of a
series of philosophical lectures acceptable. We thank our neighbor
for thus making these lectures available to the general public.
Their ability is unquestionable; and the calmness and candor which
Professor Fiske brings to the treatment of the subject is such as
to add greatly to the force of his logic.</p>

<p>The "positive philosophy" has been shown by Professor Fiske to
be much misunderstood, misapprehension not being confined solely to
the ranks of its opponents.</p>

<p>His exposition of some of the misconceptions on which Professor
Huxley has based some criticisms upon the writings of Comte,
strikes us as especially forcible; and the whole course of lectures
proves Professor Fiske to be one of the clearest and most able of
American thinkers.</p>

<p>These lectures are followed as they appear, with great interest,
and their publication in the World we regard as a real and
permanent benefit to the public.</p>

<h2>THE BATTLE FIELDS OF SCIENCE.</h2>

<h3>LECTURE BY PROFESSOR WHITE, BEFORE THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE.</h3>

<p>This lecture did not disappoint the expectations of those
familiar with the subject of the discourse, which, considering the
difficulty of restating familiar historical facts in such a manner
as to clothe them in a garb of originality, is high praise. Many,
however, found great difficulty in hearing the speaker at the back
part of the hall, and some left the room on that account. This was
unfortunate, as the lecture will scarcely be exceeded in interest
by any subsequent one of the course. The speaker said that "In all
modern history, interference with science in the supposed interest
of religion--no matter how conscientious such interference may have
been--has resulted in the direst evils both to religion and
science, and <i>invariably</i>. And on the other hand all
untrammeled scientific investigation, no matter how dangerous to
religion some of its stages may have seemed, temporarily, to be,
has invariably resulted in the highest good of religion and
science. I say <i>invariably</i>--I mean exactly that. It is a rule
to which history shows not one exception. It would seem, logically,
that this statement could not be gainsaid. God's truth must agree,
whether discovered by looking within upon the soul or without upon
the world. A truth written upon the human heart to-day in its full
play of emotions or passions, cannot be at any real variance even
with a truth written upon a fossil whose poor life was gone
millions of years ago. And this being so, it would also seem a
truth irrefragable; that the search for each of these kind of
truths must be followed out in its own lines, by its own methods,
to its own results, without any interference from investigators
along other lines by other methods. And it would also seem
logically that we might work on in absolute confidence that
whatever, at any moment, might seem to be the relative positions of
the two different bands of workers, they must at last come
together, for truth is one. But logic is not history. History is
full of interferences which have cost the earth dear. Strangest of
all, some of the most direful of them have been made by the best of
men, actuated by the purest motives, seeking the noblest results.
These interferences and the struggle against them make up the
warfare of science. One statement more to clear the ground. You
will not understand me at all to say that religion has done nothing
for science. It has done much for it. The work of Christianity has
been mighty indeed. Through these 2,000 years it has undermined
servitude, mitigated tyranny, given hope to the hopeless, comfort
to the afflicted, light to the blind, bread to the starving, life
to the dying, and all this work continues. And its work for
science, too, has been great. It has fostered science often and
developed it. It has given great minds to it, and but for the fears
of the timid its record in this respect would have been as great as
in the other. Unfortunately, religious men started centuries ago
with the idea that purely scientific investigation is unsafe--that
theology must intervene. So began this great modern war."</p>

<p>Professor White next reviewed the battle between science and
theology on the subjects of the "earth's shape, surface, and
relations," "the position of the earth among the heavenly bodies,"
in which Copernicus and Galileo struggled so bravely and
successfully for truth.</p>

<p>The lecturer said:</p>

<p>"The principal weapons in the combat are worth examining. They
are very easily examined; you may pick them up on any of the
battle-fields of science; but on that field they were used with
more effect than on almost any other. These weapons were two
epithets--the epithets 'Infidel' and 'Atheist.' These can hardly be
classed with civilized weapons; they are burning arrows; they set
fire to great masses of popular prejudices. Smoke rises to obscure
the real questions. Fire bursts out at times to destroy the
attacked party. They are poisoned weapons. They go to the heart of
loving women; they alienate dear children; they injure the man
after life is ended, for they leave poisoned wounds in the hearts
of those who loved him best--fears for his eternal happiness, dread
of the Divine displeasure. The battle-fields of science are thickly
strewn with these. They have been used against almost every man who
has ever done anything for his fellow-men. The list of those who
have been denounced as Infidel and Atheist includes almost all
great men of science--general scholars, inventors, philanthropists.
The deepest Christian life, the most noble Christian character has
not availed to shield combatants. Christians like Isaac Newton and
Pascal, and John Locke and John Howard, have had these weapons
hurled against them. Nay, in these very times we have seen a noted
champion hurl these weapons against John Milton, and with it
another missile which often appears on these battle-fields--the
epithets of 'blasphemer' and 'hater of the Lord.' Of course, in
these days these weapons though often effective in disturbing the
ease of good men and though often powerful in scaring women, are
somewhat blunted. Indeed, they do not infrequently injure
assailants more than assailed. So it was not in the days of
Galileo. These weapons were then in all their sharpness and venom.
The first champion who appears against him is Bellarmine, one of
the greatest of theologians and one of the poorest of scientists.
He was earnest, sincere, learned, but made the fearful mistake for
the world of applying direct literal interpretation of Scripture to
science. The consequences were sad, indeed. Could he with his vast
powers have taken a different course, humanity would have been
spared the long and fearful war which ensued, and religion would
have saved to herself thousands on thousands of the best and
brightest men in after ages. The weapons, which men of Bellarmine's
stamp used, were theological. They held up before the world the
dreadful consequences which must result to Christian theology were
the doctrine to prevail that the heavenly bodies revolve about the
sun, and not about the earth.</p>

<p>"The next great series of battles were fought on those great
fields occupied by such sciences as <i>Chemistry and Natural
Philosophy</i>. Even before these sciences were out of their
childhood--while yet they were tottering mainly towards, childish
objects and by childish steps--the champions of that same old
mistaken conception of rigid Scriptural interpretation began the
war. The catalogue of chemists and physicists persecuted or
thwarted would fill volumes."</p>

<p>After alluding to many other battle-fields of science which
might not for want of time be dwelt upon at length the lecturer
reviewed the battle grounds of medicine and anatomy on which some
of the severest warfare has been waged.</p>

<p>The speaker here remarked that "perhaps the most unfortunate
thing that has ever been done for Christianity is the tying it to
forms of science and systems of education, which are doomed and
gradually sinking. Just as in the time of Roger Bacon excellent but
mistaken men devoted all their energies to binding Christianity to
Aristotle. Just as in the time of Reuchlin and Erasmus they
insisted on binding Christianity to Thomas Aquinas, so in the time
of Vesalius such men gave all efforts to linking Christianity to
Galen. The cry has been the same in all ages. It is the same which
we hear in this age against scientific studies--the cry for what is
called '<i>sound learning</i>.' Whether standing for Aristotle
against Bacon, or Aquinas against Erasmus, or Galen against
Vesalius, or making mechanical Greek verses at Eton, instead of
studying the handiwork of the Almighty, or reading Euripides with
translations instead of Leasing and Goethe in the original, the cry
always is for 'sound learning.' The idea always is that these
studies are <i>safe</i>."</p>

<p>The speaker next proceeded to show that not alone in Catholic
countries, has such warfare been waged, and that even now in
Protestant America the fight is going on.</p>

<p>One of the fields on which the severest warfare had raged in
Protestant countries was that of Geology. "From the first lispings
of investigators in this science there was war. The early sound
doctrine was that fossil remains were <i>lusus naturae</i>--freaks
of nature--and in 1517 Fracastor was violently attacked because he
thought them something more. No less a man than Bernard Palissy
followed up the contest, on the right side, in France, but it
required 150 years to carry the day fairly against this single
preposterous theory. The champion who dealt it the deadly blow was
Scilla, and his weapons were facts obtained by examination of the
fossils of Calabria, (1670). But the advocates of tampering with
scientific reasoning soon retired to a now position. It was strong,
for it was apparently based upon Scripture--though, as the whole
world now knows, an utterly exploded interpretation of Scripture.
The new position was that the fossils were produced by the deluge
of Noah. In vain had it been shown by such devoted Christians as
Bernard Palissy that this theory was utterly untenable; in vain did
good men protest against the injury sure to result to religion by
tying it to a scientific theory sure to be exploded--the doctrine
that the fossils were remains of animals drowned at the flood
continued to be upheld by the great majority as '<i>sound</i>'
doctrine. It took 120 year for the searchers of God's truth, as
revealed in nature--such men as Buffon, Linnaeus, Woodward, and
Whitehurst--to run under these mighty fabrics of error, and by
statements which could not be resisted, to explode them.</p>

<p>"Strange as it may at first seem, the war on geology was waged
more fiercely in Protestant countries than Catholic, and of all
countries England furnished the most bitter opponents. You have
noted already that there are generally two sorts of attacks on a
new science. First, there is the attack by pitting against science
some great doctrine in theology. You saw this in astronomy, when
Bellarmine and others insisted that the doctrine of the earth's
revolving about the sun is contrary to the doctrine of the
Incarnation. So now against geology it was urged that the
scientific doctrine that the fossils represented animals which died
before Adam was contrary to the doctrine of Adam's fall, and that
death entered the world by sin. Then there is the attack by the
literal interpretation of texts, which serves a better purpose
generally in arousing prejudice. It is difficult to realize it now,
but within the memory of the majority of those before me, the
battle was raging most fiercely in England, and both these kinds of
artillery were in full play and filling the civilized world with
their roar. Less than thirty years ago, the Rev. J. Mellor Brown
was hurling at all geologists alike, and especially at such
Christian divines as Dr. Burkland, Dean Conybeare, and Pye Smith,
and such religious scholars as Professor Sedgwick, the epithets of
'Infidel,' 'Impugner of the Sacred Record,' and 'Assailant of the
Volume of God.' His favorite weapon was the charge that these men
were 'attacking the Truth of God,' forgetting that they were simply
opposing the mistaken interpretations of J. Mellor Brown. He
declared geology 'not a subject of lawful inquiry;' he speaks of it
as 'a dark art,' as 'dangerous and disreputable,' as a 'forbidden
province.' This attempt to scare men from science having failed,
various other means were taken.</p>

<p>"To say nothing about England, it is humiliating to human nature
to remember the trials to which the pettiest and narrowest of men
subjected such Christian scholars in our country as Benjamin
Silliman and Edward Hitchcock. But it is a duty and a pleasure to
state here that one great Christian scholar did honor to religion
and to himself by standing up for the claims of science despite all
these clamors. That man was Nicholas Wiseman, better known
afterward as Cardinal Wiseman. The conduct of this pillar of the
Roman Catholic Church contrasts nobly with that of timid
Protestants who were filling England with shrieks and
denunciations. Perhaps the most singular attempt against geology
was that made by a fine specimen of the English Don, Dean Cockburn
of York, to <i>abuse</i> its champions out of the field. Without
apparently the simplest elementary knowledge of geology, he opened
a battery of abuse. He gives it to the world at large by pulpit and
press; he even inflicts it upon leading statesmen by private
letters. But these weapons did not succeed. They were like Chinese
gongs and dragon lanterns against rifled cannon. Buckland, Pye
Smith, Lyell, Silliman, Hitchcock, Murchison, Agassiz, Dana, and a
host of of noble champions besides, pressed on the battle for truth
was won. And was it won merely for men of science? The whole
civilized world declares that it was won for religion; that thereby
has infinitely increased the knowledge of the power and goodness of
God."</p>

<p>The lecturer classed the present opposition of the Catholics to
the Free School system in this country among the long list of
battles between science and theology and concluded his lecture as
follows:</p>

<p>"But, my friends, I will not weary you with so recent a chapter
in the history of the great warfare extending through the
centuries. There are cheering omens. The greatest and best men in
the churches--the men standing at centers of thought--are insisting
with power, more and more, that religion shall no longer be tied to
so injurious a policy--that searchers for truth, whether in
Theology or Natural Science, shall work on as friends, sure that,
no matter how much at variance they may at times seem to be, the
truths they reach shall finally be fused into each other. No one
need fear the result. No matter whether science shall complete her
demonstration that man has been on the earth six thousand years or
six hundred thousand. No matter whether she reveal new ideas of the
Creator or startling relations between his creatures--the result,
when fully thought out, will serve and strengthen religion not less
than science. The very finger of the Almighty has written on
history that science must be studied by means proper to itself, and
in no other way. That history is before us all. No one can gainsay
it. It is decisive, for it is this: There has never been a
scientific theory framed for the use of Scriptural texts, which has
been made to stand. This fact alone shows that our wonderful volume
of sacred literature was not given for any such purpose as that to
which so many earnest men have endeavored to wrest it. The power of
that volume has been mighty indeed. It has inspired the best deeds
our world has known. Despite the crusts which men have formed about
it--despite the fetters which they have placed upon
it--Christianity has blessed age after age of the past, and will go
on as a blessing through age after age of the future. Let the
Warfare of Science, then, be changed. Let it be a warfare in which
religion and science shall stand together as allies, not against
each other as enemies. Let the fight be for truth of every kind
against falsehood of every kind--for justice against injustice--for
right against wrong--for beauty against deformity--for goodness
against vice--and the great warfare which has brought so many
sufferings, shall bring to the earth God's richest blessings."</p>

<h2>HOW FRENCH BANK NOTES ARE MADE.</h2>

<p>When a new batch of French notes is to be printed, an equivalent
number of the choicely prepared and preserved sheets of paper is
handed over to the superintendent of the printing office. This
office is among the inner buildings of the Bank of France, and is
governed by very rigorous rules in all things. The operatives are
all picked men, skillful, active, and silent. The sheets, the ink,
and the matrixes of the plates are kept securely under lock and key
until actually wanted. The printing is effected by steam-worked
presses. The ink is blue, and its composition known only to a few
of the authorities. An inspector goes his rounds during the
continuance of the operations, watching every press, every workman,
every process. A beautiful machine, distinct from the press, is
employed to print the variable numbers on the note; fed with sheets
of paper, it will number a thousand of them in succession, changing
the digits each time, and scarcely requiring to be touched
meanwhile; even the removal of one note and the placing of another
are effected by automatic agency. At every successive stage the
note is examined. So complete is the registration of everything
that a record is always at hand of the number of sheets rejected
ever since the Bank of France was established, be its defects in
the paper, the printing, or the numbering. When the master-printer
has delivered up his packets of printed and numbered sheets, each
note is stamped with the signature of the Secretary-General and the
Comptroller. This completes the <i>creation</i> of notes. The notes
so created are kept in a strong box, of which the Secretary-General
and the Comptroller have keys, and are retained until the day of
<i>issue</i>. The chief cashier tells the Governor that he wants a
new supply of a particular denomination of notes, the Governor
tells the council, the council tell the secretary-general and the
comptroller, and these two functionaries open their strong box, and
hand over the notes demanded. The notes at this time are not really
money; they do not become so until the chief cashier has put his
signature to each, and registered its number in a book.</p>

<p>The life of a French bank note is said to average two or three
years, and does not terminate until the condition is very shaky
indeed--crimpled, pierced with pinholes, corner creases torn, soft,
tarnished, decrepit while yet young. Some have been half-burned;
one has been found half-digested in the stomach of a goat, and one
boiled in a waistcoat-pocket by a laundress. No matter; the cashier
at the bank will do his best to decipher it; he will indeed take an
infinity of trouble to put together the ashes of a burned note, and
will give the owner a new note or the value in coin, if satisfied
of the integrity of the old one. The bank authorities preserve
specimens of this kind as curiosities, minute fragments gummed in
their proper position on a sheet of paper. Very few of the notes
are actually and irrevocably lost. During the last sixty-seven
years 24,000 bank notes of 1,000 francs each have been issued, and
of this number 23,958 had been returned to the bank by the month of
January 1869, leaving only 42 unaccounted for. Whether these 42 are
still in existence, or have seen burned into uncollected ashes, or
are at the bottom of the sea, or elsewhere, is not known. Of
500-franc notes, 24,935 have been returned out of 25,000. The bank
holds itself morally and financially responsible for the small
number of notes unreturned, ready to cash them if at any time
presented.</p>

<p>The bank sends the old notes again and again into circulation,
if verified and usable; but they are examined first, and any that
are found too defective are canceled by stamping a hole in them.
These canceled notes pass from one official to another, and are
grouped in classified bundles; the book that records the birth of
each note now receives a notification of its civil death, and after
three years incarceration in a great oak chest, a grand
conflagration takes place. A huge fire is kindled in an open court;
the defunct notes are thrown into a sort of revolving wire-cage
over the fire; the cage is kept rotating; and the minute fragments
of ash, whirled out of the cage through the meshes, take their
flight into infinite space--no one knows whither. The Bank of
France prints a certain number of notes per day, and destroys a
smaller number, so as to have always in reserve a sufficient supply
of new notes to meet any emergency; but the actual burning, the
grand flare-up takes place only about once a month, when perhaps
150,000 will be burned at once. The French go down to lower
denominations than the Rank of England, having notes of 100 francs
and 50 francs, equivalent to &pound;4 and &pound;2. There must be a
great deal of printing always going on in the Bank of France,
seeing that in 1868 they issued 2,711 000 notes, of an aggregate
value of 904,750,000 francs (averaging about &pound;13 each), and
burned 1,927,192, value 768,854,900 francs.</p>

<p>It <i>sounds</i> a very dreadful thing for 30,000,000 sterling
in bank notes to be willfully burned in one year. But there is
always a phoenix to rise from its ashes; the bank can regenerate as
fast as it kills. The Bank of France, in 1846, put in circulation a
beautiful crimson printed note for 5,000 francs; but the French
people did not like notes of so high a denomination, and all but a
very few of this kind have been returned and canceled. On one
occasion, a superb individual, wishing to pay a dowry in handsome
style, obtained twelve notes of 5,000 francs each for the purpose;
but they were returned the very next day by the banker, who much
preferred smaller notes for his general purposes. The notes now
regularly kept in circulation in France are those of 1,000, 500,
100, and 50 francs.</p>

<h2>WHAT THE NEWSPAPERS SAY.</h2>

<p>A VALUABLE PAPER.--Of all the journals published in the United
States, for the mechanic and scientific man, there is nothing that
will in any way compare with the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, published by
Munn &amp; Co., of 37 Park Row, New York. Whether as a work of
reference, a record of current scientific development, or as an
organ and exponent of our inventors, it stands alone for the
general ability of its conduct, the voluminousness and variety of
its contents, the exactitude and extent of its knowledge, and the
correctness of its information. The SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN is a credit
at once to the press and our country, and the small price of a
yearly subscription ($3), purchases, it is quite safe to say, the
largest amount of solid value to be procured for a like expenditure
in the world. With our more intelligent mechanics it has long been
a great favorite, while to the inventor it is absolutely
indispensable. It has had many imitators and competitors in its
day, but they have nearly all died the natural death of a feeble
inferiority.--<i>Argus</i> (Brooklyn, N. Y.)</p>

<hr>
<p>THE GREAT JOURNAL OF ARTS AND SCIENCE.--There is a place in the
periodical literature of America which is occupied by only one
journal; namely, the well-known SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN.</p>

<p>It is almost indispensable to a well-balanced intelligence, that
a certain proportion of its reading should be devoted to the
industrial arts and sciences, those natural manifestations of the
high mental development of the age. Every number of the journal has
sixteen imperial pages, embellished with engravings, as
illustrations, which are gems of art in themselves. It is most ably
edited, and its usefulness is not impaired by technical terms nor
dry details.--<i>Milwaukee Sentinel.</i></p>

<hr>
<p>THE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN.--This paper is the oldest in its
peculiar province in the United States, and was, for many years,
the only one. More recently others have arisen, and are following
in its footsteps; but the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN still maintains its
position as the best American journal of the inventive arts. Its
Patent Office department alone is invaluable to inventors, while
its editorial articles, illustrations, etc., give not only
information, but a constant stimulus to the productive
faculty.--<i>Mobile Register</i>.</p>

<hr>
<p>Among the papers which we could not very well do without is the
SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, issued from the well-known office of Munn
&amp; Co., 37 Park Row, New York. Carefully edited, nicely printed,
well illustrated, it is not only a complete record of the progress
of useful inventions, but a trustworthy guide to many of the
scientific topics that enlist attention at the present day. No one
can be a reader of this most valuable journal, without being kept
well informed as to current matters of scientific
discovery.--<i>Congregationalist</i> (Boston).</p>

<hr>
<p>THE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN.--In another column we publish the
prospectus of this great paper, and would direct our readers to it.
It should be on the work bench of every mechanic, and particularly
the young men of our country, upon whose intelligence and
mechanical skill depends the future dignity of labor and prosperity
of American arts and sciences.--<i>Monitor</i> (Huntington,
Pa.)</p>

<hr>
<p>We could fill our pages with similar notices, but will close
with the following from our cotemporary <i>De Hope</i>, published
at Holland, Mich., which we doubt not will be read with
interest:</p>

<p>Wij plaatsen in dit Nummer het prospectus van den SCIENTIFIC
AMERICAN. Het is een zeer schoon blad, dat vooral behoort gelezen
te worden door Handwerkslieden. Nieuwe uitvindingen, verbeteringen
op het terrein van werktuigkunde, enz, worden daar steeds in
vermeld en beschreven. De prijs is zeer matig voor zulk cen blad;
drie dollars per jaar. Dat belangstellenden de advertentie
lezen.</p>

<h2>CHINESE METHODS OF PRESERVING EGGS.</h2>

<p>As much has been said of late about the mode of preserving eggs,
it may not be uninteresting to say a few words about the Chinese
methods, as related by a French chemist, M. Paul Champion, who has
lately visited that country, and published a very interesting book
on the ancient and modern industries of that curious people. A very
common method is to place the eggs in a mixture of clay and water;
the clay hardens around the eggs, and is said to preserve them good
for a considerable time. But another and much more elaborate method
is also commonly practiced. An infusion of three pounds of tea is
made in boiling water, and to this are added three pounds of
quicklime (or seven pounds when the operation is performed in
winter), nine pounds of sea-salt, and seven pounds of ashes of
burnt oak finely powdered. This is all well mixed together into a
smooth paste by means of a wooden spatula, and then each egg is
covered with it by hand, gloves being worn to prevent the corrosive
action of the lime on the hands. When the eggs are all covered with
the mixture, they are rolled in a mass of straw ashes, and then
placed in baskets with balls of rice--boiled, we presume--to keep
the eggs from touching each other. About 100 to 150 eggs are placed
in one basket. In about three months the whole becomes hardened
into a crust, and then the eggs are sent to market; the retail
price of such eggs is generally less than a penny each. These eggs
are highly esteemed in China, and always served in good houses; but
they have undergone a strange transformation, which certainly would
not recommend them to English palates; the yolk has assumed a
decidedly green tinge, and the white is set. When broken, they emit
that unpleasant sulphurous smell which would certainly cause their
instant banishment from our breakfast-tables. However, the Chinese

certainly no disputing about tastes.</p>

<h2>STEAM BOILER INSPECTION.</h2>

<p>Mr. Alfred Guthrie, U.S. Inspector, informs us that the
following resolution was recently adopted by the Board of
Supervising Inspectors:</p>

<p>Resolved, That a special committee be appointed, to whom shall
be referred the subject-matter of steam boiler explosions, who
shall be requested to take up the subject in all its varied
complications, and present the result of their inquiries, with
their opinions of the real causes of such explosions, accompanied
by such information as may be of practical benefit and general
interest, to be reported at the next annual meeting of the board
for its consideration.</p>

<p>Mr. Guthrie, whose address will be at Washington, D.C. until
January 10, desires to receive suggestions from practical engineers
upon the subject of boiler explosions.</p>

<h2>EDITORIAL SUMMARY.</h2>

<p>Darkness of complexion has been attributed to the sun's power
from the age of Solomon to this day. "Look not upon me because I am
black, because the sun hath looked upon me." And there cannot be a
doubt that, to a certain degree, the opinion is well founded--the
invisible rays in the solar beams, which change vegetable color,
and have been employed with such remarkable effect on the
daguerreotype, act upon every substance on which they fall,
producing mysterious and wonderful changes in their molecular
state, man not excepted.</p>

<p>The three companies under whose protection Chinese are brought
into California, keep an accurate account of the condition and
employment of the persons they import. From these books it appears
that 138,000 Chinese have been brought into California. Of these,
10,426 have died, 57,323 have returned to China, and about 91,000
still remain on the Pacific coast. But only 41,000 live in
California. Of these 41,000, 9,300 are women, children, old and
decrepit, or criminals confined in the jails. The California
authorities have at length decided to admit Chinese testimony in
the courts.</p>

<p>DESIGN PATENT DECISION.--We publish elsewhere a recent elaborate
decision of Commissioner Fisher, in which he reviews the laws and
former practice of the office in regard to applications for patents
for designs, with the view to the establishment of a uniformity of
practice in regard to design patents. The decision is one of much
interest to inventors and agents, and fully warrants its
publication.</p>

<p>OIL PAPER HANGINGS.--A kind of oil paper hangings called "Oleo
Charta" is now made in England, which, it is asserted, is
impervious to wet, may be placed on new or damp walls without risk
of damage or discoloration, may be washed with soap and water as
often as required, and will last twenty years. The process of
manufacture is not explained.</p>

<h2>THE STEVENS BREECH-LOADING RIFLE.</h2>

<p>This new arm, a patent on which, was obtained through the
Scientific American Patent Agency, June 11, 1867, is destined, in
our opinion, to become a formidable rival to the breech-loading
rifles which have already attained popularity. It is one of the
most simple and effective guns we have yet seen. Only three motions
are required to load, discharge the piece, and throw out the shell
of the cartridge. The breech-block is side-hinged, and it is opened
and the shell is thrown out by simply bringing the gun to half
cock. The gun may, however, be cocked without opening the breech by
pressing the trigger while cocking.</p>

<p>The gun, when held in position, may be fired at the rate of
forty shots per minute. All the movements of the parts are directly
backward and forward; in our opinion the best that can be employed
for this purpose, and the least liable to get out of order. In
short, the gun possesses all the essentials of a first class rifle,
and has advantages which we think are not ordinarily met with in
arms of this character.</p>

<h2>A NOVEL FRENCH HAND VISE.</h2>

<p>In using ordinary hand vises several inconveniences are met
with. For instance, if it is desired to work a piece of metal of a
certain length, it must necessarily be presented obliquely on the
side of the jaw of the vise, because of its screw, which is
horizontal and forms a knob in the axis of the vise. The
consequences are, first, that on tightening the nut of the
horizontal screw vise the pressure is only exerted on the side, and
greatly tries the vise itself while obtaining an irregular
pressure; secondly, that as the piece to be worked is held
obliquely, however skilled the workman may be, he always finds
himself cramped in the execution of his work, particularly if of a
delicate nature.</p>

<p>To avoid these inconveniences a Parisian mechanic has designed
and lately patented in England the neat form of hand vise of which
we annex illustrations, Fig. 1 being an elevation and Fig. 2 a
longitudinal section. In these views, A, is a wooden or metal
handle pierced throughout its length; this handle of metal may be
made in one piece, with the nut, and the conical ferrule. B is the
ring or ferrule of the handle; and C are the jaws of the vise
worked by the adjusting screw, D, and the springs, r r. E is a
conical ferrule or shoulder, fixed or movable, and serving to open
or close the jaws of the vise accordingly as the handle is turned
right or left; this conical shoulder is protected from wear by a
tempered steel washer, v. G is a nut with collar carrying the
conical ferrule or shoulder, E, and the steel washer, v, while H H
are the joints of the jaws of the vise held by a screw, I, which
serves as a support to the adjusting screw.</p>

<p class="ctr">FIG. 1. FIG. 2.</p>

<p>This hand vise may be applied to a number of uses, and among
others it may be readily converted into a haft or handle for any
kind of tailed or shanked tool, such as files, wrenches, olive
bits, chisels, or screwdrivers, and may also serve as pincers or
nippers. It is of very simple construction.</p>

<h2>THE MOUND-BUILDERS IN COLORADO.</h2>

<p>New evidence of the existence of the Mound-Builders in the
mountain ranges of Colorado, similar to those in Montana, Utah, and
Nevada, have recently been discovered by Mr. C.A. Deane, of Denver.
He found upon the extreme summit of the snow-range structures of
stone, evidently of ancient origin, and hitherto unknown or
unmolested. Opposite to and almost north of the South Boulder
Creek, and the summit of the range, Dr. Deane observed large
numbers of granite rocks, and many of them as large as two men
could lift, in a position that could not have been the result of
chance. They had evidently been placed upright in a line conforming
to a general contour of the dividing ridge, and frequently
extending in an unbroken line for one or two hundred yards. The
walls and the mounds are situated three thousand feet above the
timber line. It is, therefore, hardly supposable that they were
built for altars of sacrifice. They were not large enough for
shelter or defense. The more probable supposition is that, like the
large mounds in Montana and elsewhere, they were places of
sepulture.</p>

<h2>THE WOVEN-WIRE MATTRESS.</h2>

<p>Most of our readers who attended the last Fair of the American
Institute, will recall an article in the furniture department,
which attracted much attention on account of its novelty and
utility. We refer to the wire mattress, or bed, manufactured by the
Woven Wire Mattress Company, of Hartford, Conn. To the ordinary
mind a new invention is interesting or not, in proportion to the
probability of its coming into every-day use, and many a good
housewife lingers in admiration over an improved sewing machine or
cooking stove, to whom a new steam engine has no attraction. For
this reason it was that the wire mattress was sat on and lain on by
the numerous visitors at the Fair.</p>

<p class="ctr"><img src="images/10b.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The engraving presented herewith will give the reader, who has
not seen the article, a good idea of its appearance. It consists of
a fabric represented below, half an inch thick, composed of fine
wire springs, each one the length of the bed; all the three hundred
spirals, being so woven and braided together, in a double "weave,"
by machinery, that a sort of wire cloth is produced. It differs
from any other material hitherto made, in that it has great
strength and elasticity. There is, in fact, no other device, except
the air or water bed, which can compare with it in its elastic
properties.</p>

<p class="ctr"><img src="images/10c.png" alt=""></p>

<p>We are informed that nine hundred pounds of dead weight of wire
were placed on it for nearly five days, without injurious effects.
This fabric is stretched on a frame, as seen in the first
engraving, the proper tension is secured to suit the fancy, and the
mattress is ready for use. It is then set into the bedstead, like
the ordinary spring bed, except that only two slats are used to
support it. Thus, with a slight covering in summer, and a thin hair
mattress for warmth in winter, a most perfect sleeping arrangement
is secured.</p>

<p>The first adaptation of the wire mattresses was for private
houses, but they have been found to have special advantages for
hospital use. They have been largely introduced into the Hartford
Hospital, the Bellevue Hospital, New York, and the Marine Hospital,
Brooklyn, and have proved to be, after months of the severest use,
with all classes of patients, a very great success for such
purposes. The elastic flexible mattresses yield to every motion and
part of the body, much to the relief of the suffering patient.</p>

<p>Another very great advantage is, that when carefully painted
they are always clean.</p>

<p>Pillows of the same materials are made soft and pliable by using
a fine wire and small coil. They are always cool, and afford the
opportunity of placing bags of ice under the head in case of
sickness.</p>

<p>One of these mattresses and a bedstead and pillows complete--all
of which the Company make--furnish, with the addition of a folded
blanket or comfortable, a perfect outfit for hospital use.</p>

<p>They are particularly useful for ships' berths, as they dispense
with the ordinary bottom, and the sacking and thick mattress.
Shippers know this.</p>

<p>We are assured that a coating of paint, carefully applied to the
well-tinned wires will protect them from rust.</p>

<p>There can be no question but that these beds, with a light
covering--scarcely more than a sheet--are especially adapted for
hot climates. The Company have already orders for them for the
Brazilian market, and they have been introduced into many of the
Southern States.</p>

<p>This wire fabric is adapted to other articles of furniture, and
is used in place of the ordinary springs in chairs, sofas, etc. For
out-door settees, lounges, car seats, and other like purposes, it
is well adapted.</p>

<p>Three patents have been issued to the Company on the wire
mattress, through the Scientific American Patent Agency. [See
advertisement of the Woven Wire Mattress Company on another

<h2>Flouring Mill Hazards.</h2>

<p>A correspondent, in discussing the causes of fires in flour
mills, gives the following facts and queries:</p>

<p>"F. Bertchey's mill, at Milwaukee, burned in September last. The
fire originated from a candle held near a bran or feed spout,
reaching from the upper to a lower floor. The ignition was instant,
and attained different points of the building at about the same
moment.</p>

<p>"On November 20, 1868, Schmidt &amp; Co's mill, at St. Louis,
burned in a similar manner, the light in this case being in a globe
lamp, but the conflagration was, nevertheless, quite as sudden and
general as in the first case cited. Other instances of like
character have occurred quite recently. And now the query is, What
caused the disaster? Whence the combustion?</p>

<p>"It has been conjectured that the bran-dust, or fine and dry
powder, passing down or up these conductors, may be the kindling
cause of the fire in these cases; but bran is not over combustible
in itself, nor do we know why it should become so when thus reduced
to an impalpable powder.</p>

<p>"Another theory is that a gas arises from the transmuting grain,
which, excluded from surrounding atmosphere in these close
conduits, becomes inflammable, and hence the results, as recited
above, whenever a lighted flame is brought in contact
therewith.</p>

<p>"Be the cause gas or dust, the disaster is the same: and is it
not a phenomenon worth studying and remedying, so far as within the
province and control of those most interested?"</p>

<p>Some similar instances came under our personal observation while
adjuster for the Aetna at its western branch. The Star Mills at
Mascoutah, Ill., burned about the year 1864. They were grinding
middlings. About three o'clock in the morning the miller in charge
went up to the chamber (a large box extending through several
stories), as he had often done before, to jar the middlings down,
they having clogged. He carried a small, open oil lamp, which he
placed on a beam, just behind and above his head. He then opened a
slide and thrust in a shovel, which started the middlings down with
a thump, raising a great dust. As this dust issued in a thin cloud
from the slide, it approached and touched the lamp, when instantly,
as if it had been coal gas, it flashed, burning the miller's hair
and beard, and filling the middlings box with a sheet of flame,
which spread with great rapidity and destroyed the mill.</p>

<p>A mill at Dover, Ky., had accumulated a large quantity of
middlings in an upper story, when the weight caused some sagging,
and a man was sent up with a shovel to "even" the bin. His pressure
was the "last straw," and the floor under the man broke through,
pouring out a cascade of middlings, which flowed down from story to
story, filling the mill with its dust. In a very few minutes it
reached the boiler room, and the instant it touched the fire it
ignited with a flash, and the mills was in flames instantly. It was
totally destroyed.</p>

<p>In this last named case the gas theory will not apply. The dust
was not confined in a spout, but was floating free in the air
throughout the mill. The phenomenon was like the others mentioned,
and seems to indicate that the fine dust itself, when floating in
the air, is the fatal incendiary.</p>

<p>The subject is worthy of a scientific analysis, such as we have
never seen bestowed upon it. The facts are well authenticated, but
the philosophy of such ignition is not generally
understood.--<i>Insurance Monitor</i>.</p>

<h2>Fire-Proof Buildings.</h2>

<p>"It has long been a vexed problem with architects and builders,
how to make a building completely fire-proof without the enormous
expense of iron beams and girders, and even this has sometimes
failed to prove a complete protection. In the building of the
National State Bank, the architect estimated that it could not be
made fire-proof in the ordinary style for less than $6,000, and
while hesitating as to the expense and seeking to provide some
remedy against the dampness incident to iron beams, Mr. Fowler
learned from the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN that Edwin May, of
Indianapolis, the well-known architect of our county jail, had
taken letters patent on a fire-proof lath for ceilings and inside
partition walls, together with a concrete floor for the protection
of the upper edge of the joist which by actual test had been
demonstrated to be fire-proof. After a critical examination of the
invention upon its merits, it was adopted, and the workmen are now
engaged in putting it in. Our citizens engaged in, or contemplating
building, will be interested in an examination of the work while in
progress."</p>

<p>[We copy the above from the <i>Lafayette</i> (Indiana)
<i>Courier</i>, and in this connection we make the following
extract from a letter just received by us from Mr. May, the
inventor:</p>

<p>"You will see by the above notice one result of my advertisement
in the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN. This is only a <i>mite</i>. I have more
than I can do, and I would say to inventors who are not realizing
what they expected from their patents, that one <i>illustrated
advertisement</i> in the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN will effect more than
a notice in all the newspapers in the United States. This is saying
a good deal but such is my belief."</p>

<h2>The Decline of American Shipping.</h2>

<p>At a meeting of the New York Chamber of Commerce, held December
16, to consider means for reviving American commerce, the following
resolutions were adopted:</p>

<p>Resolved, That this Chamber recommend to the Congress of the
United States, about to assemble, the modification of existing
laws, so that</p>

<p>I. Foreign-built steamers may be imported free of duty, and
privileged to carry the American flag, provided they are American
owned and not to be employed in our coastwise trade.</p>

<p>II. That iron plates and such other material for the
construction of steamers as may be deemed advisable, be admitted
free of duty.</p>

<p>III. That on all ship stores procurable in bond, drawback be
returned, as upon goods shipped for sale to foreign lands; and</p>

<p>Finally, That ample subsidies be granted to lines of steamers
built in American yards, to the end that competition with powerful
foreign organizations may be successfully inaugurated and
sustained.</p>

<p>The Chamber ordered the resolutions engrossed, accompanied by a
memorial forwarded to Congress.</p>

<p>These resolutions, in our opinion, embody the solution of the
question under consideration, and we trust they may be speedily and
favorably acted upon by Congress.</p>

<h2>Aerial Navigation--A Suggestion.</h2>

<p>Messrs. Editors:--As a constant reader of your invaluable paper,
many subjects of deep interest come under my observation, and
doubtless no journal throughout the land contains more instructive
reading--that which tends to accelerate the progress of scientific
investigation, and promote the general interest of the people--than
the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN. The series of articles under the head of
"Aerial Navigation," commenced on page 309, volume XXI., has,
perhaps, been read with as much pleasure and interest as anything
published in your valuable journal. I say with pleasure--because it
is really gratifying to mark the advancing steps which inventors
are making in this branch of science; and with interest--because
every new idea set forth, calculated to further the success of
aerial navigation, should be, and no doubt will be, regarded as of
great importance by every one. And, as the more suggestions placed
before the minds of those working for the improvement of any
invention, the greater number will they have from which to choose
or experiment upon, I would like to make one suggestion here, which
may be of some importance in the construction and operation of the
"Aeroport," under the supervision of Mr. Porter, of your city, a
description of which is given on pages 346-7, volume XXI., of your
paper.</p>

<p>I suggest that the propelling wheels be placed in some other
position than that given in the said description. From what little
knowledge I possess of aerial navigation, I am persuaded that it
would take less power to propel the "Aeroport" at a given speed, if
the wheels were placed at the rear or front portion of the flying
ship. My reason for being thus persuaded is, that as the forward
and aft halves of the float are cone-shaped--the center being the
base, and the front and rear ends being the vertexes--there must be
an increased velocity of the atmosphere from front to aft as the
aeroport advances. Consequently the driving wheels being placed
under the center or largest diameter of the float, they must
evidently revolve with greater rapidity in the current of air
passing between the float and the saloon, going in opposite
direction to that in which the aeroport is flying at a given speed,
than they would were they placed in front or behind where the
atmosphere is comparatively at rest. I take this view from the fact
that steamboats and other vessels proceed with greater speed, with
a given power, <i>down</i> stream than they do <i>up</i> stream,
mostly on account of the paddles striking against the current
flowing in the same direction in which the vessel is rowing. The
propelling wheels placed either at the front or rear may have the
axle extended through the end of the float to the center, and the
cog-wheel, for the chain, placed on the inner end of the axle, and
the chain descending through the bottom of the float, and connected
to the engine in the same manner as given in your paper. The chain
should be inclosed from the float to the saloon below, with a pipe
of the same material as the float, and sufficiently large to insure
the free action of the chain, and the axle of the propellers should
be made tight with suitable packing to prevent the escape of gas.
However there may be different arrangements employed for connecting
the engine to the wheels. A shaft extending directly under the
float, and reaching from the center to the axle supporting the
propellers, and connected therewith by means of side cog-wheels,
might be used; and as the shaft would necessarily diverge from a
straight line with the said axle, the shaft having the chain-wheel
on the end directly over the engine and connected therewith in the
manner proposed by Mr. Porter, I would suggest further that it
would, perhaps, be preferable to place the wheels at the front end,
that the rudder might remain in its original position, and the
aeroport could swing behind the propellers on encountering side
currents of air, and could thus be more easily guided. I firmly
believe that Mr. Porter has taken "the right step in the right
direction" to accomplish that which has been so long sought, and
which evidently will be accomplished at some future time. The air
will yet be navigated by numerous flying ships, going from one city
to another like those that now cover the broad bosom of our
oceans.</p>

<h2>Puttying Floors of Jewelers Shops and Otherwise.</h2>

<p>Messrs. Editors:--I am a reader of your valuable paper and find
in it much to interest, and many practical hints that are useful in
my vocation; I would not be without it for any consideration and I
think every mechanic in the land should take it, read it, and
profit by the reading.</p>

<p>I notice, in Vol. XXI, page 371, a communication headed, "Watch
Repairers' Shop," in which directions are given to fill the chinks
in the floor around the work-bench with soft pine and putty, etc.,
etc.; this is all well enough, but will not prevent the breaking of
pivots should a balance wheel be dropped, neither will it prevent
the wheel being stepped upon and so rendered useless, as often
happens.</p>

<p>I am a watch-maker and jeweler, and I never drop a wheel or part
of a watch on the floor. I have an apron about one yard wide, and
in the corners of it are eyelet-holes, so that I can pin it to the
bench when I am working; I have strings to it, but do not generally
tie them around me, but let it be loose in my lap as I have to jump
up, to attend to customers in the shop. In the shop where I learned
my trade (in London, England), every workman was <i>compelled</i>
to wear an apron, and so much waste of property and valuable time
was saved; the saving of <i>time</i> in <i>one week</i> will more
than pay the cost of the aprons.</p>

<h2>Western Demand for Agricultural Implements.</h2>

<p>Messrs. Editors:--I often think, on perusing your very valuable
journal of science, and the numerous mechanical and scientific
problems it unfolds, that the tendency of the age is to supersede
all manual labor by machinery. Whether such a thing is possible is
not the question for me to consider; I only know that the tendency
of universal human genius seems directed to that end.</p>

<p>I make the above observation casually, in order to introduce a
few ideas on the subject of improvement in agricultural
implements--the great <i>desideratum</i> of the West at this
moment. Here nature has opened her stores so munificently, that all
the husbandman has to do is to plow, sow, and garner the fruits of
his labor. But two great improvements are needed to enable the
western farmer to keep pace with improvements in the mechanic arts
and other kindred employment. Indeed, we at the West, particularly,
need a good, cheap, steam plow that can be made practicable for at
least the better grade of farmers. The English plan of moldboards,
that overcome all possible traction and necessitate the duplex
stationary engines, with the cumbrous "artillery of attachments,"
may do for sluggish people but will never meet the wants of the
Yankee nation.</p>

<p>The steam plow suited to the genius of our people, must, to use
a vulgarism, "get up and go." It must possess sufficient power of
propulsion and traction to pulverize the ground better, deeper, and
more rapidly than the "old way." Such is the want of the great West
in reference to preparing the soil for crops. I do not know of such
a machine in use, nor do I believe in the theory of Dr. Brainard,
that the moldboard is the only plan for properly pulverizing the
soil; for I am satisfied that such plan is wholly inadmissible in
steam plowing in this country, for want of sufficient traction for
self-propulsion, and observation has taught me that a
self-propelling plow is the only steam plow our people will
tolerate.</p>

<p>I have lately examined the drawings of a steam plow invented by
a gentleman of this city (which I am not at liberty to explain in
detail) that seems to meet the great want I have spoken of. The
invention consists in a very simple device, by which the whole
force of pulverizing the ground is applied to propel the machine,
and if this be not sufficient, an independent force may be applied,
so arranged as to govern the speed of the machine at the will of
the operator. You will, no doubt, in due time hear more of this
machine, which seems to me to meet the great want so long
experienced in Western cultivation.</p>

<p>The next great want of the West is a practical grain binder,
that shall securely bind the grain as cut. The scarcity and high
price of labor renders such a machine an absolute necessity. The
efforts to supply this great want have been numerous, but with no
flattering success so far as I am able to learn, except the machine
invented by a citizen of this place, which has already made its
mark by demonstrating that automatic machinery can and does bind
the grain as fast as cut. The machine I speak of is yet in a
chrysalis state, so to speak, but it has been worked two years in
the field, the last season without missing a bundle, though not
without the usual difficulties of all new machines in respect to
the workings of some parts--too weak, etc. It is believed that the
coming harvest will witness its triumphant success. If so, the
production of our staple cereal will be greatly cheapened. I shall
be glad to renew "old acquaintance," by a more detailed statement
hereafter.</p>

<h2>Economical Steam Engine.</h2>

<p>Messrs. Editors:--Permit me now to make a few remarks in regard
to an article on page 844, last volume of the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN,
entitled "Which is the Most Economical Steam Engine?" The
principles laid down in that article, I think are correct.</p>

<p>I run a saw-mill with an engine which fills those conditions
nearer than I ever saw, and I would like to give your readers a
brief description of it. The cylinder is 10-inch bore, and 14-inch
stroke; steam chest extends enough beyond the ends of the cylinder
so that the steam travels only 2&frac12; inches, the shortest
distance possible, after leaving the valve before it reaches the
piston-head, and the space between the piston-head and
cylinder-head is only one-fourth of an inch, the bolt heads being
counter-sunk until even. Other things about this engine are in
proportion. With this engine attached to a direct acting circular
mill, I can saw 2,000 feet of hard-wood inch boards in one
hour.</p>

<h2>Friction and Percussion.</h2>

<p>Messrs. Editors:--In reply to "Spectrum," page 358, of last
volume, I will be brief. In his third paragraph he claims that he
has merely <i>suggested</i> that friction and percussion may often
be one and the same thing; and immediately claims that in the case
of the polished button rubbing a planed pine board, the force which
overcomes and levels the undulations of the wood, is percussion,
and that percussion is also the cause of the heat; the microscopic
hills and hollows on the shining brass button skipping and jumping
along the pine, produces little infinitesimal bumpings, and so
pound out the heat. This <i>little</i> theory should be known to
the homeopaths--they could illustrate infinitesimal quantities by
it!</p>

<p>"Spectrum" treats my hammered horsenail illustration shabbily.
After indirectly acknowledging that there is a point where
hammering will no longer produce heat, he puts it on the
grindstone, subjects it to friction, and when it burns his fingers,
throws his hat in the air and shouts "Hurrah for
<i>percussion!</i>" We agree perfectly, except that he calls
hammering, <i>condensation</i>; calls friction, <i>percussion</i>;
and drops friction from the mechanical dictionary altogether.</p>

<p>A railway car axle often heats and sets fire to the packing,
when the journal is smooth as polished glass; but I never heard of
those parts of the car which are constantly undergoing percussion,
even getting uncomfortably warm. The natives of the South Pacific
produce fire by rubbing pieces of dry wood together, but I never
heard of their rapping sticks for the same purpose. I have seen a
new, sharp knife made hot enough to raise a blister, whittling a
clean dry stick of pine, and I would like to have "Spectrum" tell
us, if in all the above cases percussion is the cause of the
evolution of of heat, and what is friction doing in the mean
time.</p>

<h2>Oiling a Preservative of Brown Stone.</h2>

<p>Messrs. Editors:--I have read the article entitled, "What is to
Become of our Brown Stone Fronts," and have waited to see what
others have to say. But with so much at stake, no body seems to
know what to do or say. Being a practical painter, it has been my
lot to oil some of the best fronts in New York, namely corner of
23d Street and 5th Avenue, No. 2, West 23rd Street, also No. 1,
West 30th Street; also the residence of E.S. Higgins, the carpet
manufacturer, done by other journeymen.</p>

<p>They were very dark in color for a few weeks, but now after two
years, they are bleached almost as light as they were at first.</p>

<p>These fronts were cleaned whenever necessary, and then oiled
with fresh raw linseed oil from the press, put on pretty much as
carefully as in ordinary varnish work. No second coat or lapping
over of the oil. All was put on at once that it would take without
running down in streams.</p>

<p>The result: the oil penetrates into good dry stone probably
1&frac12; inches, making the stone hard and flinty, as any stone
cutter will soon find out if he tries to trim it.</p>

<p>It keeps the damp and therefore the frost out of the stone, as
will be seen any foggy day, the damp running down in streams on the
oiled stone, and the unoiled stone absorbing the dampness. It is
therefore necessary to oil during dry weather.</p>

<p>The oil is especially beneficial to balustrades and carvings, as
they are generally got out of soft stone. It is also beneficial
underneath balconies and porches, as the sun never has a chance to
dry the stone in such situations before the frost flakes it.</p>

<p>This I send in part payment for the great deal I have learned
from your paper.</p>

<h2>Interesting Correspondence from China.</h2>

<p>Messrs. Editors:--Your paper seems to increase in interest. I
brought the back volumes from Madras to Pekin, and am glad to refer
to them here where I must depend upon myself.</p>

<p>I have been building and repairing premises since I came here
last year. I find the carpenters and masons are very much delighted
with our tools, especially our saws, planes, borers, vise, and
hammers. Our lathe is a wonder. They use only the ancient spindle
turned backwards and forwards by a treadle or by the left hand
while the right guides the chisel or turning-tool, which cuts only
half the time. They use only the turning saw, which often fails
them because it cannot be used in splitting wide boards in the
middle, and in many other places. They are great sawyers, however.
They stand heavy pine spars on end, if rather short, say 8 feet,
the common length of many intended for making coffins, and cut them
up into three-eighths or half-inch stuff with great patience. A
longer one they will lean over and prop up, raising it towards the
perpendicular as they advance. They must have some hard jobs. I
have just measured a poplar plank in front of a coffin manufactory,
which I found to be 5 ft. 3 in. at the butt, 3 ft. 10 in. at the
top, 8 feet long, and about 8 inches thick. For a crosscut saw they
rig one like our wood-saw. I am sure it would deeply interest you
to make a visit to Pekin and see how this ancient, patient, and
industrious people do their work. It is truly painful to see how
much time they spend in making the simplest tool for want of at
least a few labor-saving appliances. Doubtless you have their tools
on show in New York. They are to me an interesting study, though I
have been long familiar with the rude tools of the Hindoos. It is
constantly suggested to me that we must have got many hints from
the Chinese, or else indeed they have taken hints from the West; or
again, which is perhaps the true solution, implements like words
have a common origin. I should think from what I have observed in a
short time, that the Chinese resemble the Europeans in their tools
more than the Hindoos--a thing I did not at all anticipate. A
clever man could write you an interesting chapter on the ways of
the Pekinese, the Chinese Manchus, Mongols, and the rest mixed
together, though the Chinese are confessedly the workers in wood,
iron, and everything else. The Manchus are mostly hangers on of the
government, living mainly upon a miserable monthly stipend.</p>

<p>The reading of your unequaled journal makes me interested in you
as if you were personal friends, and so I have run away with these
pointless remarks. I am sure you will excuse me, and not wonder
that one wishes to breathe now and then.</p>

<h2>Communication Between Deaf and Blind Mutes.</h2>

<p>Messrs. Editors:--In a recent number of the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN
I notice an ingenious method of teaching deaf and dumb persons to
converse in the dark, which is also applicable to blind mutes, and
it brings to my recollection a method which was in use among the
"telegraph boys" some years ago when I was one of them. Sometimes
when we were visiting and asked to communicate to a "brother chip,"
anything that it was not advisable for the persons around us to
know, a slight tap-tapping on the table or chair would draw the
attention of the party we asked to talk to, and then by his
watching the forefinger of the writer, if across the room, or if
near enough, by placing the hand of the writer carelessly on the
shoulder of the party we desired to communicate with, the
communication was written out in the telegraph alphabet or by
taking hold of his hand and writing upon the finger.</p>

<p>I think this method will be found much less complicated, if not
quite as rapid, as the method with both hands, and much more
convenient, as it is only necessary to have hold of one hand of the
person communicated with, and is more rapid than writing with a
pen.</p>

<p>For the benefit of those not acquainted with the telegraph
alphabet, I give it:</p>

<pre>
   A    B    C    D     E    F    G     H    I
  .-  -...  ...  -..    .   .-.  --.  ....   ..
<br>
   J     K     L    M    N    O     P     Q
  -.-.  -.-   ---   --   -.  . .  .....  ..-.

   . ..   ...    -   ..-   ...-  .--   ..-.  .. ..
<br>
   Z
  ... .
</pre>

<p>The uninitiated will observe that O differs from I in the
distance between the dots, made thus: I by two quick strokes of the
forefinger; O by one quick stroke, slight pause, and another quick
stroke; the dashes are made by holding the finger down for a short
space: thus SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN would be written:</p>

<pre>
    S    C    I   E  N   T   I   F   I    C
   ...  .. .  ..  .  -.  -  ..  .-.  ..  .. .

<p>MAGNET</p>

<p>[Nothing can compensate for want of rapidity in a language
designed for colloquy. Although our correspondent found the Morse
telegraph alphabet a resource on occasion, he would scarcely be
content to use it, and it only for life, even if emancipation from
it involved months of labor. The motions required to spell
SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN by the telegraph alphabet are thirty-nine, but
as the short dashes occupy the time of two dots for each dash, and
there are eight of these, eight more ought to be counted in a
comparison of it with an alphabet composed wholly of dots, this
would make forty-seven. To spell the same words in full by the mute
alphabet referred to would require only twenty-three motions. A
still greater disparity in rate would, we think, be found in an
entire colloquial sentence. Thus the sentence "Hand me an apple"
would require, by the mute alphabet, the time of fourteen dots,
while with the telegraph alphabet it would require the time of
thirty-nine.--Eds.</p>

<h2>Cheap Cotton Press Wanted.</h2>

<p>Messrs. Munn &amp; Co.:--Please give us any information of cheap
cotton-presses, such as small neighborhoods, or single planters, in
the South could own. In particular, a press that will put 40 pounds
cotton into each cubic foot. We want cotton better handled, and to
that end may want small bales, say 150 pounds each. But these must
be put into three or four cubic feet, or they will cost too much
for covering, ties, etc. Perhaps you can furnish us with a wood-cut
of some, or several, presses worked by hand, or by horse-power,
that will do good service, not cost too much, be simple in
operation, not require too much power, and be effective as above.
It may be for the interest of some of your clients or
correspondents to give us the facts, as we shall put them into a
report for circulation amongst the entire cotton interest of the
country.</p>

<h2>A Singular Freak of a Magnet.</h2>

<p>Messrs. Editors:--In my library hangs a powerful horseshoe
magnet which has a keeper and a weight attached of about three
ounces. This weight is sustained firmly by the attracting power of
the magnet, and is not easily shaken off by any oscillating motion,
yet through some (to me) unknown cause during each of the last ten
nights the magnet has lost its power, and the keeper and weight lie
in the morning on the bottom of the case where the magnet has hung
for many years without a like occurrence, except once on the
occasion of a severe shock of an earthquake which took place
December 17, 1867.</p>

<p>There is no possible way for this magnet to be disturbed except
by the electric current; then why should its power thus return
without the aid of a battery or keeper? Will some one explain?</p>

<h2>PRESERVATION OF IRON.</h2>

<h3>BY PROF. HENRY E. COLTON.</h3>

<p>"What is wanted is something equally applicable to large or
small pieces of iron, and which will answer to ward off the attacks
not only of the common atmospheric oxygen, but also remain
unaffected by acids or salt waters."</p>

<p>The above from a late number of the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN states
not only the writer's ideas but also one of the greatest wants of
the age. Iron is daily being put to more and more varied uses. On
land the great question is what will prevent rust; on water, what
will prevent rust and fouling of bottoms of iron vessels. We will
briefly summarize the many patents granted for this purpose.</p>

<p>Eight are for sheathing of various kinds put on in varied modes.
The most practicable of these is a system prepared by Daft. Most
iron vessels are now constructed by every other plate lapping the
edges of the one between. He proposes, instead of having the plates
all the same width, to have one wide and one very narrow plate.
This would leave a trough between the two wide plates of the depth
of the thickness of the plates. He proposes to force into this
trough very tightly pieces of teak, and to the teak, thus embedded,
he nails a sheathing of zinc. The zinc is kept clean by slowly
wearing away of its surface from action by contact with the iron
and salt water.</p>

<p>There are four patents, in which various, so-called,
non-conducting coats are put on the iron, and copper pigment in
some form put on over them. These have been specially condemned in
England, as no matter how good the non-conducting substance--and
many are so only in name--it will become rubbed off at some points,
and there the bottom will be eaten both by salt water and action of
copper.</p>

<p>Coal tar and asphaltum are the subjects of patents in various
forms.</p>

<p>One patent claims rubber or gutta-percha dissolved in linseed
oil as a vehicle in which to grind the pigment; another the same
dissolved in naphtha or bisulphide of carbon as a pigment; another
hard rubber, ground.</p>

<p>Enameling with different materials is proposed by some, while
one proposes to glaze the bottoms so that barnacles and grass would
find a slippery foothold.</p>

<p>Combinations of tallow, resin, and tar--mineral and pine--are
patented mostly to use over other paints.</p>

<p>Coal tar, sulphur, lime, and tallow, are the subject of one
patent; guano, red lead, and oil of another; while sulphur and
silica are claimed by a third.</p>

<p>Paints containing mercury, arsenic, and even strychnine, are the
subjects of several patents. A mixture of coal tar and mercurial
ointment of one.</p>

<p>Galvanism is proposed to be used in various ways--strips of
copper and zinc, or by galvanizing the plates before use. Black
lead finds a place in many compositions.</p>

<p>One patent, by a complicated process, effects a union of
metallic zinc and iron; this, granulated and ground fine, then
mixed with red lead and oil, makes the paint. It is said to be the
best of all the patented stuffs.</p>

<p>It is astonishing how many use oils derived from coal, peat, or
resin, and tars of the same.</p>

<p>There are about fifty patents for this object and with all of
them before their eyes, the British Society for the Advancement of
Art still hold the $5,000 reward for a pigment or covering which
will perfectly protect from rust and fouling. However they may puff
their products for selling, no one has the temerity to claim that
they deserve the reward.</p>

<p>We think it would be difficult to find so many expedients ever
before adopted for the accomplishment of any one object. These are
all English patents, England having necessarily been obliged to use
iron for vessels from its cheapness as well as its consequent first
introduction there. In the United States no patents worth
mentioning have been granted.</p>

<p>The first requisites for a pigment or coating for iron are, that
it should not contain any copper--the corrosive action of that
metal on iron being intense. Then if for work exposed to air it
should form such a coating as to be impervious to that gaseous
fluid, and be so constituted chemically as not to be oxidizable by
it; if under water--especially sea water--to be impermeable to
moisture, so elastic as not to crack, so insoluble as not to
chloridize; to form a perfect, apparently hard, coating: and yet
wear just enough to keep off incrustation, barnacles, or growth of
grass. In fact, this slow wearing away is the only preventive of
fouling in iron vessels. Wooden bottoms may be poisoned by
solutions of copper--and that metal has no superior for such uses,
especially when it is combined in mixture with mineral or resinous
tars and spirits--these compounds, however, are not only useless on
iron bottoms, but also injurious. What then is <i>the</i>
substance: 1st. One of the oxides of lead (red lead). 2d. The
purest oxide of iron to be found. If properly made these articles
can be carried to no higher state of oxidation, and respectively,
as to order named, they have no superiors for body and durability.
By preference, 1st, red lead, either out of or under water; 2d,
Prince's oxide of iron only, out of water. The color of these
paints--the first red, the latter brown, may be hidden by a coat of
white or tinted color. If there were to be had in combination as a
white paint, an oxide of lead and an oxide of zinc, it would be
immensely superior to either, but that such has not been produced
is rather the fault of carelessness than of possibility. Zinc
protects iron with great effect, but it is too rapidly worn in the
effort to be of lasting value. Hence the great desideratum, the yet
to be, the coming pigment is a white oxide of lead or a combined
white oxide of lead and white oxide of zinc, without sulphates or
chlorides.</p>

<p>Those materials answer very well for work exposed to atmospheric
air, and perhaps nothing will ever be found better; but a different
need is that for salt water. No mere protector of the iron from
rust can be found superior to pure red lead and linseed oil. We
have seen a natural combination of zinc, lead, and iron, which, in
our experience, ranks next; but the zinc is acted on by the
chloride of sodium, and wears away too much of the material. Red
lead, however, while covering the iron perfectly and effectually
preventing rust, and also having but little disposition to
chloridize, when it does, will foul both with grass and barnacles.
Hence, the first desideratum being obtained, how shall we
accomplish the other. The prevention of fouling may be accomplished
in two ways: First, cover the vessel's bottom with two or even
three coats of red lead, and give each time to dry hard. Then melt
in an iron pot a mixture of two parts beeswax, two parts tallow,
and one part pine resin; mix thoroughly, and apply hot one or two
coats. This mixture may be tinted with vermilion or chrome green.
It is not necessary to use any poisonous substance, as it is only
by its softness and gradual wear that it is kept clean. Second, mix
red lead and granular metallic zinc, ground fine, or such a mineral
as we have mentioned--crystalline and granular in its character.
Put on two or three coats, and allow each to set--they will never
dry hard. The zinc will slowly wear off, keeping the whole surface
clean, while there will be left enough coating of the lead to
preserve the iron from rust. The oil I would urge for these
pigments is linseed--as little boiled as possible, to be thinned
with spirits of turpentine. There seems to have been a mania for
mixtures of tar and resins, their spirits and oils; my experience
fails to show me any advantage for them on an iron bottom. They
have neither elasticity nor durability, while linseed oil has both
in a pre-eminent degree, and is no more likely to foul than they,
when in a combination that does not dry hard. Besides they are
difficult to grind, inconvenient to transport, and offensive to
use.</p>

<p>Perhaps we have not, in the opinion of some, answered the want
expressed in the first paragraph. No pigment with the requisites of
durability and cheapness will resist the attacks of strong acids on
iron. The first we have mentioned will--all such as may float in
our air from factories or chemical works. Chemically it is
converted by nitric acid and chlorine into an insoluble
substance--plumbic acid or the cyanide of lead. An experience of
more than three years, with almost unlimited means at our command
for experiment, demonstrates to us that we have indicated the means
of filling the other requisites asked for. It may be that something
new will be discovered, but we doubt it. Let any one tread the road
we have trod, investigate and experiment where and as much as we
have, and, if that place is, where we have not, and their
experience will be the same as ours.</p>

<h2>THE BANANAS AND PLANTAINS OF THE TROPICS.</h2>

<h3>[For the Scientific American.]</h3>

<p>Poets have celebrated the banana plant for its beauty, its
luxuriance, the majesty of its leaves, and the delicacy of its
fruit; but never have they sufficiently praised the utility of this
tropical product. Those who have never lived in southern countries
are unable to fully appreciate its value. Some look even with
indifference upon the gigantic clusters of this fruit, as they are
unloaded from the steamers and sailing vessels; and yet they
deserve special attention and admiration, for they are to the
inhabitants of the torrid zone, what bread and potatoes are to
those of the north temperate zone.</p>

<p>The banana tree is one of the most striking illustrations of
tropical fertility and exuberance. A plant, which in a northern
climate, would require many years to gain strength and size, is
there the production of ten or twelve months. The native of the
South plants a few grains, taken from an old tree, in a moist and
sandy soil, along some river or lake; they develop with the
greatest rapidity, and at the end of ten months the first crop may
be gathered, though the cluster and bananas are yet small; but the
following year one cluster alone will weigh some sixty or more
pounds. Even in the South they are always cut down when green, as
they lose much of their flavor when left to ripen or soften on the
tree.</p>

<p>The trunk of the tree, if it may be so called, and which grows
to a hight of some fifteen feet, is formed only by the fleshy part
of the large leaves, some of which attain a length of eighteen
feet, and are two and a half feet in width. While from an upper
sprout you perceive the large yellow flowers, or already formed
fruits, you see underneath a cluster, which is bending the tree by
its weight.</p>

<p>The plantain tree is much the same as the banana, with the
difference, however, that its fruit cannot be eaten raw, like the
banana's, and that it is much larger in size. Almost every portion
of the banana tree is useful. First of all, the nutritious fruit.
The plantains when green and hard, are boiled in water or with meat
like our potatoes, or they are cut in slices and fried in fat, when
they are soft and ripe. There is a singularity about the boiled
plaintain, worthy of being mentioned. Pork especially, and other
meats are so exceedingly fat in the tropics that they would be most
disgusting or even impossible to eat with either bread or potatoes,
but the plaintain seems to neutralize or absorb all the greasy
substance, and the fattest meat is thus eaten by natives and
foreigners without the least inconvenience.</p>

<p>Ripe bananas are mashed into a paste, of which the natives bake
a sort of bread, which is very nourishing, though somewhat heavy.
This paste, which contains much starch, can be dried, and thus kept
for a length of time, which is often of great service to mariners.
The young sprouts are used and prepared like vegetables, and the
fibrous parts of the stalks of the majestic leaves are used like
manilla for ropes and coarse cloth.</p>

<p>The utility of the leaves is a theme rich enough to fill a
volume; they are used to cover the huts, for table-cloths and
napkins, or wrapping paper. The dough of bread, instead of being
put in a pan, into the oven, is spread on a piece of plantain leaf;
it will neither crisp nor adhere to the bread when taken out. The
Indians of America carry all their products, such as maize, sugar,
coffee, etc., in bags made of this leaf, which they know how to
arrange so well, that they transport an "arroba," or twenty-five
pounds any distance without a single grain escaping, and without
any appliance other than a liana or creeper to tie it up with. As
to the medicinal qualities of the leaves, they are numerous.
Indeed, a book has been written upon them. I speak, however, from
my own experience. The young, yet unrolled leaves are superior to
any salve or ointment. If applied to an inflamed part of the body,
the effect is soothing and cooling, or if applied to a wound or
ulcer, they excite a proper healthy action, and afterwards
completely heal the wound. Decoctions made of the leaves are used
among the natives for various diseases.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of the world this plant has ranked among the
first in the Flora of Asia. The Christians of the orient look upon
it as the tree of Paradise which bore the forbidden fruit, and they
think its leaves furnished the first covering to our original
parents. According to other historians, the Adam's fig was the
plant, which the messengers brought from the promised land to
Moses, who had sent them out to reconnoitre. "It is under the shade
of the <i>musa sapientium</i>, that," as recorded by Pliny, "the
learned Indians seated themselves to meditate over the vicissitudes
of life, and to talk over different philosophic subjects, and the
fruit of this tree was their only food." The Oriental Christians,
up to the present date, regard the banana almost with reverence;
their active fancy beholds in its center, if a cut is made
transverse, the image of the cross, and they consider it a crime to
use a knife in cutting the fruit.</p>

<p>In the holy language of the Hindoo, the Sanscrit, the Adam's fig
is called "modsha," whence doubtless, the word "musa" is derived.
It is generally believed that the plant came from India to Egypt in
the seventh century; it still forms a most important article of
commerce in the markets of Cairo and Alexandria. In the year 1516,
the banana was brought to the West Indian Islands by a monk, since
which time it has rapidly spread over the tropics of America, and
is found to the twenty-fifth degree north and south of the equator.
It is equally indispensable and is appreciated by the immigrant and
by the native as a beautifier of the landscape; affording shelter
from the sun and rain, and giving bread to the children; for if
every other crop should fail, the hungry native looks up to the
banana tree, like a merchant to his well-filled storehouse.</p>

<h2>PUTTING UP STOVES.</h2>

<h3>BY MARK TWAIN.</h3>

<p>We do not remember the exact date of the invention of stoves,
but it was some years ago. Since then mankind have been tormented
once a year, by the difficulties that beset the task of putting
them up, and getting the pipes fixed. With all our Yankee ingenuity
no American has ever invented any method by which the labor of
putting up stoves can be lessened. The job is as severe and
vexatious as humanity can possibly endure, and gets more so every
year.</p>

<p>Men always put their stoves up on a rainy day. Why, we know not;
but we never heard of any exception to this rule. The first step to
be taken is to put on a very old and ragged coat, under the
impression that when he gets his mouth full of plaster it will keep
the shirt bosom clean. Next, the operator gets his hand inside the
place where the pipe ought to go, and blacks his fingers, and then
he carefully makes a black mark down the side of his nose. It is
impossible to make any headway, in doing this work, until this mark
is made down the side of the nose. Having got his face properly
marked, the victim is ready to begin the ceremony.</p>

<p>The head of the family--who is the big goose of the
sacrifice--grasps one side of the bottom of the stove, and his wife
and the hired girl take hold of the other side. In this way the
load is started from the woodshed toward the parlor. Going through
the door, the head of the family will carefully swing his side of
the stove around and jam his thumb nail against the door post. This
part of the ceremony is never omitted. Having got the family
comfort in place, the next thing is to find the legs. Two of these
are left inside the stove since the spring before. The other two
must be hunted after, for twenty-five minutes. They are usually
found under the coal. Then the head of the family holds up one side
of the stove while his wife puts two of the legs in place, and next
he holds up the other while the other two are fixed, and one of the
first two falls out. By the time the stove is on its legs he gets
reckless, and takes off his old coat, regardless of his linen.</p>

<p>Then he goes for the pipe and gets two cinders in his eye. It
don't make any difference how well the pipe was put up last year it
will always be found a little too short or a little too long. The
head of the family jams his hat over his eyes and taking a pipe
under each arm goes to the tin shop to have it fixed. When he gets
back, he steps upon one of the best parlor chairs to see if the
pipe fits, and his wife makes him get down for fear he will scratch
the varnish off from the chairs with the nails in his boot heel. In
getting down he will surely step on the cat, and may thank his
stars that it is not the baby. Then he gets an old chair and climbs
up to the chimney again, to find that in cutting the pipe off, the
end has been left too big for the hole in the chimney. So he goes
to the woodshed and splits one side of the end of the pipe with an
old axe, and squeezes it in his hands to make it smaller.</p>

<p>Finally he gets the pipe in shape, and finds the stove does not
stand true. Then himself and wife and the hired girl move the stove
to the left, and the legs fall out again. Next it is to move to the
right. More difficulty now with the legs. Move to the front a
little. Elbow not even with the hole in the chimney, and the head
of the family goes again to the woodshed after some little blocks.
While putting the blocks under the legs, the pipe comes out of the
chimney. That remedied, the elbow keeps tipping over, to the great
alarm of the wife. Head of the family gets the dinner table out,
puts the old chair on it, gets his wife to hold the chair, and
balances himself on it to drive some nails into the ceiling. Drops
the hammer on wife's head. At last he gets the nails driven, takes
a wire swing to hold the pipe, hammers a little here, pulls a
little there, takes a long breath, and announces the ceremony
concluded.</p>

<p>Job never put up any stoves. It would have ruined his reputation
if he had. The above programme, with unimportant variations, will
be carried out in many respectable families during the next six
weeks.</p>

<h2>THE MAGIC LANTERN.</h2>

<p>The invention of the magic lantern dates back to 1650, and is
attributed to Professor Kircher, a German philosopher of rare
talents and extensive reputation. The instrument is simple and
familiar. It is a form of the microscope. The shadows cast by the
object are, by means of lenses, focussed upon something capable of
reflection, such as a wall or screen. No essential changes in the
principles of construction have been made since the time of
Kircher; but the modern improvements in lenses, lights, and
pictures, have raised the character of the instrument from that of
a mere toy to an apparatus of the highest utility. By its
employment the most wonderful forms of creation, invisible,
perhaps, to the eye, are not only revealed but reproduced in
gigantic proportions, with all the marvelous truth of nature
itself. The success of some of the most celebrated demonstrations
of Faraday, Tyndall, Doremus, Morton, and others, was due to the
skillful use of the magic lantern. As an educator, the employment
of this instrument is rapidly extending. No school apparatus is
complete without it; and now that transparencies are so readily
multiplied by photography upon glass, and upon mica, or gelatin, by
the printing press or the pen, it is destined to find a place in
every household; for in it are combined the attractive qualities of
beauty, amusement, and instruction.</p>

<p>The electric light affords, probably, the strongest and best
illumination for the magic lantern; then comes the magnesium light;
but their use is a little troublesome and rather expensive; next to
these in illuminating power is the oxy-hydrogen or Drummond light.
The preparation of the gases and the use of the calcium points
involve considerable skill.</p>

<p>Need has long been felt for some form of the magic lantern,
having a strong light, but more easily produced than any of those
just mentioned; and this has at last been accomplished, after
several years' study and experiment, by Prof. L.J. Marcy, 632 Arch
St., Philadelphia, Pa.</p>

<p>The "Sciopticon," is the name of his new instrument, and from
actual trial we find that it possesses many superior qualities. Its
lenses are excellent, and in illuminating power its light ranks
next to the oxy-hydrogen. The sciopticon light is produced from
ordinary coal oil by an ingenious arrangement of double flames,
intensifying the heat and resulting in a pencil of strong white
light. Prof. Marcy's instrument is the perfection of convenience,
simplicity, and safety. Any one may successfully work it and
produce the most brilliant pictures upon the screen. It is
peculiarly adapted for school purposes and home entertainment.
Those who wish to do a good thing for young people should provide
one of these instruments. Photographic transparencies of remarkable
places, persons, and objects, may now be purchased at small cost;
while there is no end to the variety of pictures which may be drawn
by hand at home upon mica, glass or gelatin, and then reproduced
upon the screen by the sciopticon.</p>

<h2>The Largest Well in the World--Capacity 1,000,000 Gallons of
Water per Day.</h2>

<p>One of the grand necessities of the Prospect Park, Brooklyn,
N.Y., that of providing for a continual supply of water for all the
purposes of the Park developed itself, as the Commissioners
progressed with their stupendous undertaking. Mr. Stranahan, the
President of the Board, after carefully weighing the cost, the
practicability, and importance of having an independent water
supply for the Park, advised the Commissioners of the plan which
had suggested itself, and the calculations which had been made by
the engineers relative to the project, and the work was commenced,
the first idea being to secure at least a partial supply of water
by means of a well constructed in the Park. The subject was thus
treated in the last annual report of Mr. C.C. Martin, the engineer
in charge:</p>

<p>"This well has been located on the south side of Lookout Hill,
near the lake, and work was commenced upon it late in the season.
After a careful consideration of various methods for sinking the
well, it was decided to build the wall and then to excavate the
material from within, trusting to the weight of the wall to force
it down. Sixteen feet of the wall were laid securely bolted
together, before the excavation was commenced. A derrick with a
boom fifty-five feet in length was set up near the wall, so that
the sweep of the boom commanded the interior of it. Iron buckets
containing fourteen cubic feet each were obtained, and a six-horse
power hoisting engine purchased. With these appliances the
excavation was commenced, and carried on with slight interruption
until the work was suspended on account of the frost."</p>

<p>The well is now completed, and is one of the most important
features of the Park. It is worthy to rank as a feat of engineering
skill with, any of the great works of modern times. The
Commissioners decided to put its powers to the test yesterday
afternoon, but owing to the unpropitious weather of the forenoon
the trial was postponed. Nevertheless, Commissioners Stranahan,
Fiske, and Haynes, with Mr. Martin, engineer in charge, and Mr.
John Y. Culyer, his assistant, were at the well. During the last
summer some difficulties were encountered in the sinking of the
wall, which were set down by superficial observers as the utter
failure of the enterprise. Mr. Stranahan received but little
encouragement from his fellow Commissioners, some of whom had never
seen greater works of engineering than the construction of street
sewers. He assumed the responsibility of seeing the work through,
feeling that the whole thing depended entirely upon the ability of
the engineers, in which he had abundant faith. All obstacles were
surmounted; the work proceeded and the well is now finished, and so
far as is known, is understood to be the largest one in the
world.</p>

<p>The outer wall is fifty feet in diameter, two feet thick, and
fifty-four feet high. The inner curb, or wall, is thirty-five feet
in diameter and two feet thick, having a depth of ten feet. The
masonry, as seen from the top of the structure, is a marvel of
neatness and solidity. The water surface in the well is thirteen
feet above high-tide level, and the depth of water in the well is
fourteen feet. The pump foundations are entirely independent of the
walls. This plan was adopted so as to obviate any possible
difficulty which might arise from displacement. The pump is the
Worthington patent, and, with a pressure of forty pounds, is
capable of raising one million gallons of water every twenty-four
hours a height of 176 feet, and is competent to a lift of 180
feet.</p>

<p>The boiler house is a neat, pressed-brick structure trimmed with
Ohio stone, standing on the surface near the mouth of the well. The
interior of the well is reached by a spiral stairway built in the
wall, and commencing in the boiler house. In this way the engineer
is able to reach the pump. It is a fact worthy of notice in
connection with the construction of the wall, or rather the sinking
of it, that the outer wall rests upon four feet of wooden cribwork,
two feet thick, and having an iron shield. The inner wall is built
upon a similar crib only two feet deep, also shielded with
iron.</p>

<p>The Commissioners were led to the construction of this well in
presence of the danger at any time of some accident taking place in
connection with the Brooklyn Water Works which would render it
necessary for the Water Board to cut off the Park supply so as to
secure the citizens from suffering. This well has more than the
necessary capacity to supply the Park abundantly with water,
yielding most when most is needed. This is established by the
discovery that the time of drought from which the well is, or may
be, likely to suffer, occurs in the Fall. Besides these facts, it
further appears that in order to furnish the supply of water to the
Park the Water Board would have to go through the process of
pumping their water twice to convey it to the required elevation,
equal to 225 feet from its original level.</p>

<p>The work of the well will be to supply the pools at an elevation
of 133 feet. From the pools the water is conducted to the lake.
Besides this, there is an independent connection with the lake by
which, as necessity may suggest, the water can be directed to the
lake, a lift of only seventy feet. The lake, when completed, will
occupy an area of fifty acres, which will be kept continually
supplied with fresh water, the arrangements being such, or to be
such, as will insure a permanent change of water, and prevent any
of the evils that may arise from stagnancy. The well is fed from
the earth, consisting of a circuit of two miles, with a fall of
five feet to the mile. For this reason it does not appear easy to
exhaust the supply, as when the water is pumped out to four or five
feet from the surface of the well it is replaced at a rate equal to
the demand. Every allowance has been made for evaporation from the
lake and pools, and the supply is regarded as inexhaustible.
Another important fact here suggests itself; that is, that
sufficient rain falls during the season in the area of two miles
around the well to make the supply perennial. The Prospect Park
well is a credit to Brooklyn.--<i>New York Times</i>.</p>

<h2>PAPER FOR BUILDING.</h2>

<p>Our readers will find in another column an advertisement of this
new building material which is now attracting much attention in the
West, and of which we have received very favorable reports. It has
been recently tested in Chicago with the result we are informed of
fully establishing its utility. It is said that a house twenty-two
feet long, sixteen wide, and fourteen high, can be covered on the
outside for less than $9; and a house thirty-six feet by
twenty-two, and twenty feet high, for $20. The building can be done
at any season, and can be finished with great speed, and there are
said to be numerous other advantages connected with the use of the
paper. It differs from ordinary paper in consistency, compactness
and solidity. In the manufacture it is subjected to a pressure of
hundreds of tuns, which squeezes out the liquid matter, leaving a
substance of the right thickness. It is said to be proof against
damp and gnawing of vermin, and it being an excellent non-conductor
of heat, must make a warm dwelling in winter and a cool one in
summer. It is used in the place of plastering for inside walls.</p>

<h2>Improved Muzzle-Pivoting Gun.</h2>

<p>We are indebted for the following able description and criticism
of this Prussian gun to our able contemporary, <i>The
Engineer</i>.</p>

<p>Viewed as a piece of mechanism, nothing can well be more
beautiful in mutual adaptation of parts to the fulfillment of given
and rather recondite movements, and in point of execution, than
this muzzle-pivoting arrangement of Herr Gruson's; but having said
this we are compelled to add, as impartial engineering critics,
that it is nothing more.</p>

<p class="ctr"><a href="images/14a.png">
<img src="images/14a_th.jpg" alt=
"GRUSON'S SYSTEM OF MUZZLE-PIVOTING APPLIED TO MONITORS."></a></p>

<p class="ctr">GRUSON'S SYSTEM OF MUZZLE-PIVOTING APPLIED TO
MONITORS.</p>

<p>A very few words of description, aided by the very clear
engraving annexed, will suffice to make the arrangement plain to
every mechanical reader. The entire structure is metallic, chiefly
of cast iron or of steel. Upon the platform of the casemate, or
deck of the ship, or turret, is laid the heavy bed or traverse
plate, cast hollow in iron, holding the vertical pivot at its
forward end, on which the gun slide traverses in azimuth, and at
its rear end the segment plate, bolted down and separately
adjustable as to position upon the bedplate. The slide is also a
ponderous hollow casting, the upper surfaces of which, on which the
gun carriage runs forward or recoils, are curvilinear in a vertical
plane, so that the inclination to the horizon is greatest at the
rear end. At the rear end of the slide it traverses upon two heavy
cast-iron turned conical rollers, which are geared together and
actuated by the winch handle and spur gear, seen in our engraving;
by these the slide is practically held fast in any position on the
bedplate. The gun itself--in the model, a steel breech-loader, on
the Prussian regulation system, very slightly modified--is
sustained between two high and ponderous cheek plates of cast iron,
which constitute the sides of the carriage, and which are connected
together strongly at the lower edges by a heavy base or bottom
plate, and at the top by two light cross distance bolts. The muzzle
and breech extremities of the piece project well beyond those
cheeks. Along the bottom of the trough of the carriage, directly
under the gun, lies a nearly horizontal hydraulic press cylinder,
the pump and handle actuating which are seen in the figures to the
proper left of the gun, and the supply of water for which is
contained in the hollow bottom of the carriage. On each side cheek
of the carriage is formed, by curved planing, a circular segmental
race, opening inward or toward each other, rectangular in cross
section and into each of which is fitted a segmental block just
filling it up, and occupying a portion of its length so as to slide
easily up or downward through the whole range of the arc or
segment.</p>

<p>The center point of the length of each of those blocks carries
one side of the gun, which is connected also with the two heavy
radius bars seen outside the cheeks, and pivoted close to the
segment races on the outside, and with a system of link work
between the gun itself and the crosshead of the ram of the
hydraulic cylinder, which gives motion to the gun in elevation or
depression, through a vertical arc, the imaginary center of which,
and of the segments of the side cheeks, is situated in the
horizontal diameter across the muzzle of the gun. This is in brief
the muzzle-pivoting part of the arrangement, of which, were it
worth while to go into its details, we should need some further
diagrams to make it quite clear. Nor is it worth while to go into
the description of various minor points of refinement about the gun
mounting, such as the very exposed long tangent scale seen in the
figure, by which the elevation or depression is read off, nor the
still more exposed and rather ricketty arrangement by which the
rear sight is arranged to rise and fall with the gun, and allowance
for dispart avoided. The recoil of the gun is resisted through and
by the segment blocks in the side cheeks, and by the heavy radius
bars, etc., and thus transferred to the carriage itself. This moves
upon four eccentro-concentric rollers, in all respects identical
with those brought before the Ordnance Select Committee of Woolwich
by Mr. Mallet, in 1858--then rejected, after some time adopted, and
brought into use in our own service, where they are now universal,
and from which they have been adopted into every artillery in the
world, and, we understand, without the slightest recognition of the
inventor's rights. On the axle of each of these rollers is keyed a
circular eccentric cam plate, those at the same side being
connected together by a linking bar so as to move in concert.
Adjustable tripping plates attached to the sides of the slide, are
so arranged that when the loaded gun has been run forward its
carriage base rests hard down, with its full weight upon the top
faces of the slide, and thus the recoil is made under the full
resistance due to the friction of the entire load. Arrived at the
highest point, it rests there until loaded. The cam plates being
then given a slight motion of rotation by the help of socket
levers--the rectangular projections to be received by which are
seen on the top edges of the cam plates in the figure--the
carriage, by its own commenced descent, gets again upon its
rollers, and runs forward upon these at once into firing position.
The two elevated horns which are seen standing up at the rear part
of the slide above the roller frame are designed to receive the
thump of the two short buffer-blocks--seen at the rear part of each
carriage cheek--in the event of the recoil not being wholly
expended in raising the weight of gun and carriage, etc., along the
curved racers of the slide. These buffer-blocks bear against plugs
of vulcanized india-rubber secured in the bottoms of the buffer
cylinders.</p>

<p>We have thus, though very briefly, described the whole of this
mounting. As a carefully thought out and elaborated piece of
elegant mechanical complication Herr Gruson's muzzle-pivoting
carriage attracted much attention at Paris, in 1867, and its merits
were regarded as great by those whose thoughts went little further
perhaps. We should have been glad had it been in our power to have
joined in its praise. We are, however, obliged honestly to say
that, however highly creditable to its designer as an ingenious and
capable mechanism, it shows that he has never realized to himself
as a practical artillerist the primary, most absolute, and
indispensable conditions of construction for a serviceable
muzzle-pivoting gun for either land or sea service.</p>

<p>As to the general merits, or general conditions, of
muzzle-pivoting, however, once in doubt at first, these are
admitted now by all; and the latter resolve themselves almost into
this--that system of muzzle-pivoting must be best which, while
preserving the essential point of leaving the muzzle of the gun
free of any direct attachment, i.e., with an imaginary, not an
actual, pivot of vertical arc motion, shall be <i>the simplest
possible</i> in its parts, have the least details, the fewest parts
capable of being struck by splinters or shot, and all its parts of
such materials and character as to receive the smallest amount of
injury if so struck. In every one of these aspects Herr Gruson's
mounting is at fault. With parts and movements far more ingeniously
adapted than those of the crude and unskillfully designed
muzzle-pivoting carriages of Captain Heathorn, also exhibited at
Paris, and much exhibited and exposed since, the Gruson mounting is
even more complicated, expensive, and liable to injury of every
sort to which a gun carriage can be conceived liable. We may even
venture to affirm that ponderous as was the mass of cast iron,
etc., in the Paris model carrying only a 12-pounder gun, were it
all enlarged in such ratio as might appear to suit for a 10-inch
25-tun rifled gun of the British type, the almost proverbial
relations, between weight, velocity of impulse, and brittleness of
cast iron, would show themselves, in the whole machine going to
pieces within a very few rounds.</p>

<h2>Stock Feeding by Clock Work.</h2>

<p>Mr. F. B. Robinson, of North Haven, Conn., has invented a very
neat arrangement, whereby horses or stock can be fed at any time
required with certainty and without personal attention at the time
of feeding. His invention consists of a hopper with a drop bottom
in which the provender is placed. A latch secures the drop bottom,
the latch engaging with a spring catch. A simple arrangement of
clock work on the principle of the alarm clock, may be set to
release the spring at any hour or minute desired, when the drop
falls and the provender falls through a chute into the feeding
trough. This invention may be adapted to feeding any number of
horses or cattle, only one clock being required. We regard the
invention as one of much value. By its use much neglect of careless
attendants may be obviated, and a farmer without help, might leave
home for an evening's entertainment, or absent himself on business,
without fear that his stock would suffer. Besides being so
convenient the cost of the apparatus is a mere bagatelle.</p>

<h2>Milk, and What Comes of It.</h2>

<p>Orange County has long been a laud flowing with milk
and--butter. Three or four of these most beautiful autumn days were
spent by us, says a writer in <i>Harper's Weekly</i>, among the
farmers which are supposed to butter our New York city bread, and
qualify our tea and coffee. Recent mechanical improvements have
taken away much of the traditional romance of the farm, but, on the
whole, the loss is more than made up by the gain of perfect system
and wonderful adaptation. Instead of four or five cows, known by
such names as Brindle, Bess, and Sukey, milked by rosy-cheeked
maidens, we have now droves of fifty or a hundred, milked by men,
who know them only as "good" or "poor milkers."</p>

<p>In some fine farms a large and luxuriant pasture, with running
brooks and border of woodlands, affords, with the herd feeding in
it, a beautiful picture; and the substantial barns constructed to
keep the cattle comfortably cool in summer and warm in winter, with
ample drinking troughs and stalls for fastening up at night, are
indicative of the good shelter at hand when winter storms drive the
cows indoors. To the farmyards the cows are brought night and
morning, in summer, to be milked. The strained milk is put into
large cans holding forty quarts, such as the milkmen use in
distributing it through the city. These cans are then put into
tanks made in some cool running stream, where the water comes
nearly to the top of the can. Frequent stirring is necessary until
the animal heat is quite gone. The milk is then fit to be sent to
the cars. This process can never safely be omitted for, paradoxical
though it may seem, milk is "fresher" and sweeter when it reaches
the consumer if it is delayed at the farm for at least twelve
hours. Even in hot weather, it is more certain to keep sweet when
twenty-four or thirty-six hours elapse between the milking and the
using in the city.</p>

<p>There has been much discussion as to the best means of cooling
milk for market, and patent pails have been tried in which the milk
passes directly from the cow through small, coiled tubes surrounded
by ice. But this rapid cooling does not work well, and practical
experience indicates that the old simple process is the best. Every
well-appointed farm must have, therefore, a cool and unfailing
stream of water. There are two such streams in one of the farms we
visited. One passes through the barn, furnishing drinking troughs
for the cattle, and a tank for cooling milk in winter. The other,
running through the pasture, supplies a trout-breeding pond, and
furnishes a tank for summer use. In a little hut under the trees,
the milk cans are kept in a stream, which even the severe drought
of last summer did not dry, nor the heat raise to a temperature of
60&deg;.</p>

<p>We are assured most positively that none of the spring water
finds its way over the mouth of the can into the milk. Its
dilution, of which there is so much just complaint, must be done,
if at all, in the city, for the wholesale buyer is said to have
such means of testing the milk as effectually protects him against
the farmer. May the man be busy at work who is to give each family
such a protection. We have heard it said that one end of a small
piece of common tape placed in a pan of milk will carry from it all
the water into another vessel in which the other end of the tape
should be placed; but we have never found this a safe test.</p>

<p>Strange to say, no butter is made on these large milk farms. The
supply for the family is obtained from market, or, more rarely,
from a neighbor who churns all his milk for the accommodation of
those who send all theirs to the city. Our notions of the way to
make butter were decidedly overturned on going to such a dairy. No
setting of the milk in shallow pans for cream to rise; no skimming
and putting away in jars until "churning day," when the thick cream
was agitated by a strong arm until the butter came, then worked and
salted. Instead, there is a daily pouring of the unskimmed soured
milk into a common churn, perhaps somewhat larger than ordinary.
The dasher is fastened to a shaft, which is moved by a crank. The
crank is turned by means of a nearly horizontal wheel some eight or
ten feet in diameter, which is kept in motion by a dog, sheep, or
calf standing on it, something after the manner of the old
tread-mill.</p>

<p>When taken from the churn, the butter is worked by hand as of
old. The farmer with whom we have talked said he was about
determined to send his milk to the creamery, since butter-making
made it so hard for the women. Surely woman is less a drudge than
she used to be. If, after being relieved from the labor of
churning, the remaining working of the butter is considered too
hard for the farmer's wife, the day of a woman's redemption must be
near at hand.</p>

<p>Only one butter farm, have we been able to find, and not enough
is made there to supply the immediate neighborhood. Where, then,
does all the Orange county butter come from? Mostly from the West.
Farmers buy from the vicinity of the Alleghenies, and even further
west, large quantities, which they sell in the original packages or
repack in pails. Since railroads have become so numerous, New York
drinks up all the milk in Orange county, and must butter her bread
elsewhere.</p>

<p>The largest institution for the disposition of milk is the
Creamery, which is, in other words, a cheese factory. Here is
brought the milk which the farmers themselves are unable properly
to prepare for market, for want of cool springs or sufficient help.
Received here, it is placed in deep but narrow tin pails holding
twelve or fourteen quartz. These are floated in large tanks of
water. From these pails the cream is carefully taken and sent to
market. The skimmed milk is then placed in a large vat and heated,
by means of steam pipes to about 80&deg;. Then the rennet is put
in. From twenty to thirty minutes suffices for curdling, and the
mass is then stirred to separate the curd from the whey. After
which it is heated still more; and then the whey, passing off
through a strainer, goes to feed hogs, while the curd remains in
the vat, to be salted and worked before putting into the presses.
In two or three hours the curds become hard enough for the canvas
to be put upon them ready for the shelves. Very carefully they must
then be watched, lest the fly lying in wait for them makes in them
a snug house for her family. Greasing and turning must be a daily
labor, and some weeks must pass before they are sufficiently cured
for market.</p>

<p>For the benefit of city consumers, who are paying ten and twelve
cents a quart for milk, from a tenth to a quarter of which is not
infrequently pure Croton, we may add that the highest price the
farmer ever gets for his milk is seven cents a quart; and he
sometimes sells it for as low as two cents and a half. Our friends,
the milkmen, have, therefore, it will be seen, a pretty good margin
for freight and profit.</p>

<h2>Improved Hay Elevator.</h2>

<p>The method most generally used for elevating hay is evidently
not the most economical application of the power of horses for the
accomplishment of the purpose desired. The tackle involves a great
deal of friction, and as the quantity which can be thus raised at
once is, probably, on the average, not more than from 150 to 200
lbs, much more time is employed in re-adjusting the fork, than
would be the case if a larger quantity were elevated.</p>

<p>The invention under consideration supplies a means whereby it is
claimed hay may be unloaded with far greater facility than
heretofore, with less labor to the team and with fewer hands than
are at present employed.</p>

<p>A primary gear wheel is propelled horizontally by a lever worked
by a horse. The primary gear impels a pinion keyed to the shaft of
a windlass, upon which is wound the elevating rope, whenever the
clutch, A, is made to operate through the cord and lever, B. This
cord runs over a pulley on the under side the wood framework at C,
and its further end may be held in the hand of the workman on the
hay load, who, when he has properly adjusted the fork, pulls the
cord which operates the clutch, and the "fork-full" of hay is at
once elevated. The cylinder of the windlass, not being keyed to the
shaft, only operates when the clutch is closed by the cord.</p>

<p>The horse, or horses which furnish power to the machine, may,
therefore, keep on traveling in the same direction, and no time is
lost in stopping and backing, as in the method in general use.</p>

<p class="ctr">DERR'S CAPSTSTAN FOR ELEVATING HAY FORKS.</p>

<p>There is no doubt but that this is a cheap, durable, and
desirable machine, and one that can be used to great advantage, not
only for the elevation of hay, but for many other purposes. We
think it would be found a decided improvement in discharging
cargoes of coal from barges, and for handling coal in storage
yards.</p>

<p>The inventor claims that twice as much hay can be raised in a
given time by its use, as can be done by the old method; and it
dispenses with one hand at the barn or stack.</p>

<p>A coupling at D, enables attachments to be made, which extend
the usefulness of the machine very much. It may be used as a power
for driving wood saws, cutting fuel, thrashing, and other work
where a simple horse power is desirable.</p>

<h2>IMPROVEMENT IN LAMP WICKS.</h2>

<p>Our engravings show a novel substitute for the cotton lamp wick.
The wick, two forms of which are shown in Figs. 1 and 2, are made
of glass, and are filled preferably with pulverized gypsum,
although any finely-ground stone, mineral, or metal may be
employed. The bottom of the glass tube is closed by wire gauze, or
other suitable strainer, through which the fluid flows; and is
carried by the capillary attraction of the pounded material to the
top of the wick.</p>

<p>Thus a permanent wick is obtained, which may be employed with
any form of lamp, and will last for an indefinite time. It may also
be used in connection with an open cup, which the inventor terms a
poor man's lamp. A perforated card is laid upon the top of the cup
or tumbler as a support to the wick.</p>

<p class="ctr"><img src="images/15b.png" alt=""></p>

<p>It may be used either with or without a chimney, and it is
claimed that with good kerosene oil it is perfectly safe, and
consumes less of it, while it may be also used as a candle.</p>

<h2>Great Transformation.</h2>

<p>Seven years ago, says the Port Said correspondence of the London
<i>News</i>, there was nothing to distinguish Ismailla or the
smiling lake before you from the rest of the desert, and all was
sand. It is the canal which has raised up the numerous handsome
villas and fine gardens. Fresh water is all that is needed to turn
the arid desert into a fruitful soil; and the supply of this is
provided by the subsidary canal which the company has formed side
by side with that broad salt one which now unites two worlds.
Wonderful stories are told of the productiveness of the gardens,
and a walk through any of those belonging to the leading officials
stationed at Ismailla is to verify them all. Vines with large
bunches of grapes pendent from their branches; orange trees with
green fruit just showing a golden tint; ivy, roses, geraniums from
England, and an endless variety of rich tropical plants are all
flourishing. In the centre of the town is a square with trees and a
building clothed with rich creepers in its midst. Everything here
looks French. A handsome boulevard runs down to the point of
embarkation, the streets and squares are on the true Parisian
model, and there are <i>cafes</i>, billiard rooms, and <i>cafe
chantants</i> which might easily belong to Nantes or Lyons. There
are of course huge gaps where the houses and shops will be; the
roads are, many of them, still of sand; camels draw carts, and
generally pervade the place in long strings; but with all this you
are kept in a state of wonder during your stay at Ismailla at the
marvelous conversion which has taken, place under your eyes.</p>

<p>C.H.G., of N.Y.--To make pure nitrate of silver, dissolve pure
silver in pure nitric acid, evaporate the solution to dryness, or,
if crystals are preferred, evaporate until the solution is
sufficiently concentrated to form crystals. If you can not get pure
silver, you may purify it by dissolving coin in nitric acid,
filtering the solution and precipitating the silver in the form of
a chloride by hydrochloric acid. Next wash the precipitate with hot
water until the washings cease to redden litmus paper. Next mix the
pure chloride of silver while yet moist with its own weight of pure
crystallized carbonate of soda, place the mixture in a covered
porcelain crucible and heat very gradually until the fusing point
of silver is reached. The reduced silver will be pure and may be
removed by breaking the crucible. Wash the button thoroughly with
hot water to remove the flux. In dissolving the pure silver thus
obtained in nitric acid, it is better to use an excess of acid; the
excess will be driven off by heat in evaporation.</p>

<p>G.B., of Iowa.--Nominal horse power is merely a conventional
expression for diameter of cylinder and length of stroke, and does
not apply to the actual power of the engine. It is found by
multiplying the cube root of the stroke in feet by the square of
the diameter in inches and dividing the product by 47. This rule is
based upon the postulate established by Watt, that the speed of a
piston with two feet stroke is 160 feet per minute, and that for
longer strokes the speed varies as the cube roots of the length of
the stroke. It is needless to say this rule is not observed in
modern practice, yet the expression, nominal horse power, is like
many other relics of past time still retained. The above rule does
not apply to high pressure engines. For such engines Bourne has
given the following rule: Multiply the square of the diameter of
the cylinder in inches by the cube root of the stroke in feet, and
divide by 15.6. The real power of an engine is estimated from the
mean effective pressure in the cylinder--not the boiler--and the
speed of the piston. Your data are insufficient to determine the
horse power of your boiler. The horse power of boilers is estimated
from the extent of heating surface when the grate and all other
things are correctly proportioned, but with them as with engines,
only actual test will positively determine it. The pipe you mention
ought to be enlarged as proposed.</p>

<p>W.H.R., of Mass.--Pressure acts independently of the mode of
application. A tun laid upon the head of a wedge would produce the
same effect as though it were applied through toggles. When,
however, a weight is dropped its effect increases as the square of
its velocity.</p>

<p>J.B., of N.Y.--We recommend you to get "Appleton's Dictionary of
Mechanics." Also send for descriptive catalogue to Henry Carey
Baird, Philadelphia, from which you will be able to judge for
yourself what works are suited to your requirements.</p>

<p>T.D.H., of Mass.--Ammonia, in a weak solution, may be used to
cleanse the scalp, but is not recommended for the purpose. Borax in
solution is better. The supposed preservation of the color of the
hair by its use is a mistake.</p>

<p>F.B.H., of Ill.--So far as we know, nothing better than the flax
seed bag has been discovered for packing the lower end of tubes in
artesian wells. We have never heard of any trouble arising from the
method and think you will have none.</p>

<p>L.G. of Mass.--Express the decimal ratio of the diameter of a
circle to the circumference to which you refer, as a mixed vulgar
fraction, and you will have what you ask for, if we understand your
query.</p>

<p>A.H.S., of Sandwich Islands.--We know of no substance that in
our opinion, could be used advantageously to paint the interior of
sheet-iron evaporating pans for concentrating cane juice.</p>

<p>L.B., of Wis.--We would be glad to assist you but the data you
furnish are not sufficient. The accurate solution of such a problem
involves the higher mathematics.</p>

<p>A.H.M.--All animal and mineral oils are destructive to rubber.
Linseed oil will not dissolve it. Oils should not be allowed to get
on rubber belting.</p>

<p>T.W.J., of Pa.--For your rollers try some emery mixed in a
solution of gum shellac in good alcohol.</p>

<p>E.B., of Mass.--The patent can be corrected by reissue.</p>

<p>J.M.T., of Ind.--To find the proper area for a safety valve
port, when the evaporating surface is properly proportioned to the
engine power, multiply the square of the diameter of the piston in
inches by the speed in feet of the piston per minute, and divide
the product by 375 times the pressure on the boiler per square
inch. Having decided upon the length of the lever, the distance of
the valve stem from the fulcrum, and the point from which the
weight will be suspended, the weight necessary will be found by
multiplying the area of the valve port in inches into the pressure
per square inch in the boiler in pounds, and this product into the
distance of the center of the valve stem from the fulcrum in
inches, and dividing the product thus obtained by the distance from
the fulcrum to the point of suspension of the weight in inches. The
quotient will give the weight in pounds.</p>

<p>A.K.S., of Ohio.--The inclination of the poles of a planet to
the plane of its orbit, determines its zones and also its seasons.
The inclination of the earth's axis is twenty-three and one half
degrees. This places the tropics the same distance each side of the
equator, and the polar circles the same distance from the poles.
The torrid zone is therefore forty-seven degrees wide, and the
temperate zones each forty-three degrees wide. As the planets vary
in their inclination of their axis to the planes of their orbits,
it follows that their zones and seasons differ from those of the
earth.</p>

<p>W.H.C., of Texas.--The teeth of a circular wood saw to be driven
by foot-power, should be not larger than those of the ordinary hand
crosscut. The fly-wheel ought to have a rim weighing from eighty to
one hundred pounds, and it should be, for a 12-inch saw, not less
than a foot in diameter. It should be placed on the saw arbor. The
belt should not run on the fly-wheel, but on a special pulley, and
the treadle and crank motion should be so adjusted that the foot
will move through an arc of from 10 to 12 inches.</p>

<p>A.H.B., of Pa.--We advise you to use a battery in coating the
small gray castings, of which you write, with copper. It will be
all the more satisfactory in the end. The best polishing material
to put in with them in the tumbler we think would be leather
cuttings and sweepings. They will not need returning to the tumbler
after being coppered. We recommend you to get "Byrne's Practical
Metalworkers Assistant," published by Henry Carey Baird,
Philadelphia.</p>

<p>J.H.G., of Tenn.--Don't put oil in your boiler to prevent
incrustation. It will not probably do any good, and it will cause
much foaming, while besides that it is a waste of heat, it is
injurious to engines.</p>

<p>S.S.R., of Tenn.--No ammoniacal engines are, so far as we are
aware, running in this country.</p>

<p>C.E.C., of Ohio.--The varnish for patterns is common shellac
varnish. It is sometimes made black by lampblack.</p>

great regularity, and the material be turned in any direction in
order to execute small designs. Secondly, the invention relates to
improvements in the arrangement of the shuttle, whereby it is
caused to pass through the loops formed by the waxed thread without
touching it.</p>

<p>PACKING AND ATOMIZING CAN.--F.L. Palmer, Sr., New York
city.--This invention relates to improvements in cans for packing
insect powder and other like finely powdered substances which, in
use, require to be delivered in atomic jets for penetrating
crevices where insects secrete themselves, and it consists in
providing such cans with stoppers having nozzles, through which
stoppers or nozzles the passages are temporarily closed in a way to
be readily opened for use; also, in providing the cans with nozzles
at or near the bottom temporarily plugged in which tubes may be
connected so that the powder may, when required for use, be readily
blown out in atomic jets, whereby the said cans are made to
subserve the uses of packing cans and discharging atomizing cans,
with but trifling additional expense, whereas, at the present time,
users of such powders are compelled to buy expensive atomizing
cans, to which the powder must be transferred from the packing
cans, before it can be properly used, or in the absence of such
cans the powder is scattered in an ineffectual and wasteful way in
or about the resorts of the insects.</p>

<p>REMEDY TOR RHEUMATISM.--H.H. Munroe, Louisville, Ky.--This
invention relates to a new and useful improvement in a remedy for
rheumatism.</p>

<p>BENNY.</p>

<p>S.R. Wells, of this city, has published in pretty form "Benny,"
a Christmas ballad, by Annie Chambers Ketchum, a poem which has
already appeared in the <i>Phrenological Journal</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The prospectus of EVERY SATURDAY, for 1870, by Fields, Osgood
&amp; Co. of Boston, promises to give us that excellent journal in
a new and enlarged form, with the additional attraction of
illustrations, engraved from designs by leading European artists.
This publication will therefore hereafter present weekly, not only
the cream of European literature, but the cream of European art.
The high character of the publishers of this journal is an ample
guarantee that this promise will be fulfilled in the most
satisfactory manner.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>LIPPINCOTT'S MAGAZINE, for January, also presents a varied and
select bill of fare, containing among other things, Part XIII. of
Robert Dale Owen's novel "Beyond the Breakers," "The Fairy and the
Ghost," a Christmas tale, with six amusing illustrations; a curious
and interesting article on "Literary Lunatics," by Wirt Sikes, "Our
Capital," by William R. Hooper, and very much more excellent matter
in the way of stories poems, and essays.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The "Mobile Weekly Register," the oldest Democratic paper in the
South, is said to have reached a larger circulation than was ever
attained by any journal South of Mason and Dixon's line. It is full
of interesting varied matter, having an able agricultural
department, presided over by the veteran editor and successful
agriculturist, Hon. C.C. Langdon. Its general literature, poetry,
stories, etc., make it highly acceptable to the ladies. The year
will open with a new continued story, of deep interest, by one of
the most distinguished writers of the day. The price was recently
reduced to $3.00 per year, which, for so large a paper (12 pages),
is extremely cheap.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We have received the January number of "Demorest's Mirror of
Fashions," a work that interests the ladies. Also "Demorest's Young
America," a fine magazine for boys and girls. Both these serials

<h2>U.S. Patent Office</h2>

<h2>How to Obtain Letters Patent for New Inventions.</h2>

<h3>Information about Caveats, Extensions, Interferences Designs,
Trade Marks; also, Foreign Patents.</h3>

<p>For a period of nearly twenty-five years, MUNN &amp; CO. have
occupied the position of leading Solicitors of American and
European Patents, and during this extended experience of nearly a
quarter of a century, they have examined not less than fifty
thousand alleged new inventions, and have prosecuted upward of
thirty thousand applications for patents, and, in addition to this,
they have made, at the Patent Office, over twenty thousand
preliminary examinations into the novelty of inventions, with a
careful report on the same.</p>

<p>The important advantages of MUNN &amp; CO.'S Agency are, that
their practice has been ten-fold greater than that of any other
Agency in existence, with the additional advantage of having the
assistance of the best professional skill in every department, and
a Branch Office at Washington, which watches and supervises, when
necessary, cases as they pass through official examination.</p>

<h3>CONSULTATIONS AND OPINIONS FREE.</h3>

<p>Those who have made inventions and desire a consultation are
cordially invited to advise with MUNN &amp; CO. who will be happy
to see them in person at the office, or to advise them by letter.
In all cases, they may expect an HONEST OPINION. For such
consultations, opinion, and advice, NO CHARGE is made. A
pen-and-ink sketch and a description of the invention should be
sent.</p>

<h3>TO APPLY FOR A PATENT,</h3>

<p>a model must be furnished, not over a foot in any dimension.
Send model to MUNN &amp; CO., 37 Park Row, New York, by express,
charges paid, also, a description of the improvement, and remit $16
to cover first Government fee, and revenue and postage stamps.</p>

<p>The model should be neatly made, of any suitable materials,
strongly fastened, without glue, and neatly painted. The name of
the inventor should be engraved or painted upon it. When the
invention consists of an improvement upon some other machine, a
full working model of the whole machine will not be necessary. But
the model must be sufficiently perfect to show with clearness the
nature and operation of the improvement.</p>

<h3>PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION</h3>

<p>is made into the patentability of an invention by personal
search at the Patent Office, among the models of the patents
pertaining to the class to which the improvement relates. For this
special search, and a report in writing, a fee of $5 is charged.
This search is made by a corps of examiner of long experience.</p>

<p>Inventors who employ us are not required to incur the cost of a
preliminary examination. But it is advised in doubtful cases.</p>

<h3>COST OF APPLICATIONS.</h3>

<p>When the model is received, and first Government fee paid, the
drawings and specification are carefully prepared and forwarded to
the applicant for his signature and oath, at which time the agency
fee is called for. This fee is generally not over $25. The cases
are exceptionally complex if a higher fee than $25 is called for,
and, upon the return of the papers, they are filed at the Patent
Office to await Official examination. If the case should be
rejected for any cause, or objections made to a claim, the reasons
are inquired into and communicated to the applicant, with sketches
and explanations of the references; and should it appear that the
reasons given are insufficient, the claims are prosecuted
immediately, and the rejection set aside, and usually <b>Without
Extra Charge to the Applicant.</b></p>

<p>MUNN &amp; CO. are determined to place within the reach of those
who confide to them their business, the best facilities and the
highest professional skill and experience.</p>

<p>The only cases of this character, in which MUNN &amp; CO. expect
an extra fee, are those wherein appeals are taken from the decision
of the Examiner after a second rejection; and MUNN &amp; CO. wish
to state very distinctly, that they have but few cases which can
not be settled without the necessity of an appeal; and before an
appeal is taken, in any case, the applicant is fully advised of all
facts and charges, and no proceedings are had without his sanction;
so that all inventors who employ MUNN &amp; CO. know in advance
what their applications and patents are to cost.</p>

<p>MUNN &amp; CO. make no charge for prosecuting the rejected
claims of their own clients before the Examiners and when their
patents are granted, the invention is noticed editorially in the
SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN.</p>

<h3>REJECTED CASES.</h3>

<p>MUNN &amp; CO. give very special attention to the examination
and prosecution of rejected cases filed by inventors and other
attorneys. In such cases a fee of $5 is required for special
examination and report, and in case of probable success by further
prosecution, and the papers are found tolerably well prepared, MUNN
&amp; Co. will take up the case and endeavor to get it through for
a reasonable fee, to be agreed upon in advance of prosecution.</p>

<h3>CAVEATS</h3>

<p>Are desirable if an inventor is not fully prepared to apply for
a Patent. A Caveat affords protection, for one year, against the
issue of a patent to another for the same invention. Caveat papers
should be carefully prepared. The Government fee on filing a Caveat
is $10, and MUNN &amp; Co.'s charges for preparing the necessary
papers are usually from $10 to $12.</p>

<h3>REISSUES.</h3>

<p>A patent when discovered to be defective, may be reissued by the
surrender of the original patent, and the filing of amended papers.
This proceeding should be taken with great care.</p>

<h3>DESIGNS, TRADE MARKS, AND COMPOSITIONS</h3>

<p>can be patented for a term of years, also, new medicines or
medical compounds, and useful mixtures of all kinds. When the
invention consists of a medicine or compound, or a new article of
manufacture, or a new composition, samples of the article must be
furnished, neatly put up. Also, send a full statement of the
ingredients, proportions, mode of preparation, uses, and
merits.</p>

<h3>PATENTS CAN BE EXTENDED.</h3>

<p>All patents issued prior to 1861, and now in force, may be
extended for a period of seven years upon the presentation of
proper testimony. The extended term of a patent is frequently of
much greater value than the first term; but an application for an
extension, to be successful, must be carefully prepared. MUNN &amp;
Co. have had a large experience in obtaining extensions, and are
prepared to give reliable advice.</p>

<h3>INTERFERENCES</h3>

<p>Between pending applications before the Commissioners are
managed and testimony taken; also, Assignments, Agreements, and
Licenses prepared. In fact, there is no branch of the Patent
Business which MUNN &amp; Co. are not fully prepared to undertake
and manage with fidelity and dispatch.</p>

<h3>FOREIGN PATENTS.</h3>

<p>American inventors should bear in mind that five
Patents--American, English, French, Belgian, and Prussian--will
secure an inventor exclusive monopoly to his discovery among ONE
HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLIONS of the most intelligent people in the
world. The facilities of business and steam communication are such,
that patents can be obtained abroad by our citizens almost as
easily as at home. MUNN &amp; Co. have prepared and taken a larger
number of European Patents than any other American Agency. They
have Agents of great experience in London, Paris, Berlin, and other
Capitals.</p>

<p>ADVERTISEMENTS</p>

<p><i>The value of the</i> SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN <i>as an advertising
medium cannot be over-estimated. Its circulation is ten times
greater than that of any similar journal now published. It goes
into all the States and Territories, and is read in all the
principal libraries and reading-rooms of the world. We invite the
attention of those who wish to make their business known to the
annexed rates. A business man wants something more than to see his
advertisement in a printed newspaper. He wants circulation. If it
is worth 25 cents per line to advertise in a paper of three
thousand circulation, it is worth $2.50 per line to advertise in
one of thirty thousand.</i></p>

<p><b>STATEMENT.</b></p>

<p>ORDINARY FURNACE, from 15th to 20th April, produced 23,195 lbs.
of Muck Bar, and 295 lbs. Scrap Bar, worked double turn. Day turn
started at 3 A.M., and was done by 1 P.M. Night turn went on at 2
P.M., and was done by 11 P.M., worked 5 heats to each turn.
Consumed 350 bushels of coal. Furnace was lighted on Sunday out of
coal. The Stevenson Furnace, from 15th to 20th April, produced
29,160 lbs. of Muck Bar, and 515 lbs. of Scrap Bar, worked double
turn. Day turn started at 3 A.M., and was done by 10 A.M. Night
turn started at 11 A.M., and was done by 6 P.M., worked 6 heats to
each turn. Consumed 300 bushels of coal. Furnace was lighted on
Sunday out of coal. The same weight of heats of Pig and Scrap were
weighed to each Furnace. On Stevenson Furnace, 3,963 lbs. more Muck
Bar, and 220 lbs. more Scrap Bar were made, with 50 bushels less
coal than were used in other furnace. The saving in ore (fix) in
former over latter during the week, was 450 lbs., by actual weight.
A very important feature is the great saving accomplished in brick
and brick-laying. The first Stevenson Furnace, put up three months,
has not had any repair put upon it, and is, to-day, in good working
order, while the ordinary furnaces are generally repaired about
every two weeks. The cost, over ordinary furnace, is about seventy
dollars.</p>

<p>We cheerfully bear witness to the truth of the above statements
of Mr. Stevenson. They are rather under than over the mark. The
quality of iron made in his furnaces is the same as made by
ordinary kind. We think it a valuable improvement, and intend to
introduce it as fast as possible in our forge. J. PAINTER &amp;

<p>TO INVENTORS AND MANUFACTURERS IN THE UNITED STATES--</p>

<p>Mr. George Wood, Wood's Museum and Menagerie, respectfully and
earnestly invites the attention of Inventors and Manufacturers to
the fact that, at a large expense, he has arranged a hall in the
Museum Building, for the purpose of exhibiting to the public
Models, Machines, and all the products of inventive genius in
active working operation. The space allotted for this purpose
embraces 6,000 square feet, supplied with Steam-power, Gas, and all
the requirements of the Workshop, the Factory, and the Laboratory,
which will be kept open every day and evening, and form a perpetual
MECHANICS' FAIR, affording an opportunity to Inventors and
Mechanics to place their products before thousands of daily
visitors at a nominal tariff. Inventors and Mechanics are earnestly
invited to co-operate in this laudable and advantageous enterprise,
and are requested to call on or address MR. WALTER P. NEWHALL,
Superintendent of Machinery and Models. GEO. WOOD, Proprietor.

<p>Pratt's "Astral" Oil.</p>

<p>UNLIKE MANY OTHER ILLUMINATING OILS, the Astral Oil is perfectly
pure and free from all adulterations of any kind. It emits no
offensive smell while burning, gives a soft and brillant light, and
can be used with as little danger as gas. Chemists pronounce it the
best and safest Illuminating Oil ever offered to the public; and
insurance companies indorse and urge upon consumers the use of the
"Astral" Oil in preference to any other. Thousands are now burning
it, and in no instance has any accident occurred from its use. A
lamp filled with it upset and broken will not explode or take fire.
To prevent adulteration, the Astral Oil is packed only in the
Guaranty Patent Cans, of 1 gallon and 5 gallons each, and each can
is sealed in a manner that cannot be counterfeited Every package,
with uncut seal, we warrant. The universal testimony of consumers
is that the "Astral" Oil is perfect; a single trial serves to
establish it in the family.</p>

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
